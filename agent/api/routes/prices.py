"""/v1/prices — daily OHLCV bars for charts.

Proxies Polygon so the API key never reaches the mobile client. Polygon's free
tier is 5 req/min, so bars are cached twice: in-process for a few minutes, and
in SQLite per (ticker, date) so a restart or deploy doesn't send one upstream
request per rendered chart into that budget.
