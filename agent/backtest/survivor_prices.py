"""Historical bars that stay attached to the issuer the backtest meant.

`dataflows/sp500_history.py` already reconstructs point-in-time index
membership, so a backtest can ask "who was in the S&P 500 in June 2021" and
get Twitter, SVB Financial and IHS Markit back rather than today's survivors.
That half of survivorship safety has been done for a while. The other half —
*prices* for those names — has not, and feeding the first half into
`backtest/data.py` as it stands does something worse than losing the delisted
names. It silently substitutes a different company's prices for them.

Two provider behaviours make that happen, both measured against the live keys
on 2026-09-07 rather than assumed:

  * **yfinance returns nothing for a delisted symbol, and a stranger's prices
    for a recycled one.** TWTR, ATVI, SIVB, CERN, XLNX, VMW, SPLK, PXD, CTXS,
    NLSN, ABMD, SGEN, HZNP, MXIM, ALXN, DISCA — sixteen names, zero rows each.
    But SBNY came back with 345 rows starting 2024-08-15, and INFO with 306
    starting 2024-10-09. Signature Bank was seized in March 2023 and IHS Markit
    merged into S&P Global in February 2022; those bars belong to whoever holds
    the ticker now (INFO is an ETF today). A loader that reports "SBNY: 345
    bars" has not found Signature Bank's history, and nothing in its output
    says so.

  * **Polygon has the delisted history, and silently truncates the range to
    whatever the plan covers.** A request fully outside the window is an honest
    `NOT_AUTHORIZED`. A request that *overlaps* it is not: asking TWTR for
    2018-01-01 → 2022-10-27 returns 288 bars beginning 2021-09-08, HTTP 200,
    no flag. Every backtest in this repo is configured 2018-2025, which is
    exactly the overlapping case, so the silent version is the one that fires.

So the guard here is not "drop delisted tickers". It is: **prove the symbol
meant the same issuer for the whole span before using it, and never report a
span the provider did not actually return.**

Issuer identity comes from Polygon's point-in-time reference endpoint, which
carries a CIK — the SEC's permanent issuer id, and the only field in the
response that a ticker recycle cannot preserve. Names drift for benign reasons
(re-brands, share-class edits) and comparing them would flag those as
recycling; CIKs do not. Probing is O(log n) per ticker: read the CIK at each
end of the window, and only when they disagree bisect for the day it changed.
The result is an exact boundary, not a sampled guess.

Where the evidence runs out, the answer is a refusal rather than a default.
A symbol whose CIK cannot be read at a probe point is `unknown`, and an unknown
segment is never merged into the usable span — the same rule `exit_paths` uses
for a bar that touched both bracket legs and `stop_coverage` uses for an order
status it does not recognise. Assuming continuity is how a stranger's prices
get into a backtest in the first place.

Nothing here trades, decides, or touches the box: reference lookups and daily
aggregates, both read-only.

    """The spellings of `ticker` worth asking Polygon for, best guess first.

    The membership layer normalises class shares to the hyphen form, because
    that is what Wikipedia's tables and yfinance use — `sp500_history` does the
    `.`→`-` rewrite in two places. Polygon uses the dot form, and the two are
    the same security written two ways, not two securities.

    What makes this worth a dedicated step rather than a blind rewrite is how
    Polygon says no, measured on 2026-09-08:

      * The **aggregates** endpoint does not say no at all. `BF-B` and `MRSH`
        both come back **HTTP 200, `status: OK`, zero results** — byte-identical
        to each other and to a company whose history genuinely ran out. A loader
        that only asks for bars books a spelling mistake as a delisting, in the
        one report whose entire purpose is counting delistings.
      * The **reference** endpoint does distinguish them, and not in the shape
        the rest of this module expects: `BF-B` and `BRK-B` are **HTTP 400**
        (unparseable symbol), while `MRSH` is a clean **404** (a symbol nobody
        held). `BF.B` and `BRK.B` return real CIKs and 1083 bars.

    So the dot form is not a cosmetic preference — it is the difference between
    1083 bars and silence.

    The list is short on purpose. Only a trailing one-or-two-letter share class
    is rewritten, so a warrant or unit suffix is left alone rather than guessed
    at, and the original spelling is always tried first so a ticker that
    legitimately contains a hyphen is never overridden by the rewrite.
