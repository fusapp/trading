# Phase 6 — daily paper-trading run.
#
# For each ticker in the universe:
#   1. Generate a FRESH LLM decision (real Anthropic call, ~$0.50-1.50)
#   2. Run risk sizer + stale/headroom/stop guards
#   3. Submit a bracket order to Alpaca PAPER (--submit)
#   4. Persist decision + order + update to the trade log DB
#
# Designed to run post-US-close (22:30 UTC) on weekdays via systemd timer.
# Idempotent per (ticker, date): the executor's client_order_id dedupes,
# and the stale/headroom guards stop accidental double-entries.
#
# Cost: ~$0.50-1.50 LLM per ticker. With 11 tickers × 22 trading days that's
# ~$120-360/mo on the current 2-tier Opus/Sonnet routing. ADR-006 per-agent
# Haiku routing + prompt caching cuts this ~2-3x — apply after the eval window.

# Councils side by side, orders one at a time: COUNCIL_PARALLELISM.
#
# At 1 (the default, and what any invalid value falls back to) each ticker is
# one scripts.trade process that councils and then sends its order, one ticker
# after another, as it always has. Above 1 the run has two passes:
#
#   1. Up to COUNCIL_PARALLELISM councils at once, each its own scripts.trade
#      process with its own timeout and log. `--plan-dir` makes each stop after
#      sizing: it records the decision for the second pass and touches nothing
#      at the broker, no submit and no cancel. Their logs go into the run log
#      in universe order once all are done.
#   2. One process, scripts.submit_plans, takes the recorded decisions in
#      universe order and does for each what scripts.trade does after its
#      council: reads the kill switch, account, positions and open orders
#      again, sizes under every cap and runs the executor with all its guards.
#      Each order is sized against the ones placed before it, as in the
#      sequential run, so nothing needs a lock between processes.
#
# The one difference: the pre-council gate in pass 1 sees the book before any
# of this run's orders, so a name the sequential run would skip for want of
# cash is councilled (one council's cost). Pass 2 asks the same gate again
# against the book as it stands then and sends nothing for it, so what reaches
# the broker is the same.
#
# A record is used at most once and only by this run (scripts/submit_plans.py),
# and the directory holding them is removed when the run ends, however it ends.
# A stop (systemctl stop, Ctrl-C) stops both passes: the councils in flight are
# killed, their partial logs kept, nothing more is sent, and the run exits 143
# so the dead-man's switch hears a failure.
#
# Each council in flight is a stream of model calls against one API key's rate
# limit, so raise this only after checking a run's 429s and retries.
