"""Manage positions that are already open — the pass this system never had.

The daily run decides what to BUY. Nothing decided what to do with a position
afterwards: `atr_trailing_stop` and `time_exit` have had zero callers since they
were written, so a stop stayed wherever entry put it and no position was ever
closed on age. Of 33 closed trades, exactly one was an agent sell decision and
24 were kill-switch flattens.

This runs BEFORE the decision loop so capital released here is available to the
theses formed minutes later — which is the point. The book holds ~10 names
against an 11-name universe and a 10% per-name cap, so it is at the cap on
everything it knows and every subsequent buy is trimmed to zero (167 refusals
say exactly that). Without an exit path the freeze is permanent.

    python scripts/manage_positions.py                # report only (default)
    python scripts/manage_positions.py --submit       # actually amend/close
    python scripts/manage_positions.py --refresh-bars # bring held names' bars up to date first

Exit codes, which daily_run.sh turns into pages:

    0  everything planned was done
    1  something failed, and every lot it touched is as protected as before;
       or, with --submit, a held name's stop was not maintained because an
       input was refused (stale bars, a mark the bars do not back, an ATR
       that is not a measurement, a level at the market), or because the
       refresh could not fetch bars for a name the cache has none for. The
       stop stands where it was, and without a page it would stand there
       every night. Also with --submit, a due time exit the exit budget
       held back: a bad input that reads the book as due is held to three
       names only until a person looks. Also a time exit deferred because the
       market was open (a pass run by hand in the session), and a time exit
       queued by an earlier run that the broker rejected, cancelled or expired
       at the open, or left done for the day with shares unsold: the lot had
       neither stop nor exit from then until now.
       That last is read off the book for every held name, whatever this
       pass then does with it (closes it again, back-fills it, or leaves it
       to the exit budget), and named by the first run after it. Which open
       it met is the broker's calendar's to say, not its stamp's date: a run
       past 00:00 UTC stamps the date the next 22:30 run has too.
    3  a time exit may have left shares with no stop: a close ended `unknown`
       or `naked`, or the re-cover after it could not place what it had to.
       A cancel still on its way strips its stop after this run, while the
       coverage check at the end of the run still sees the stop standing, so
       this code is the only thing that can say so while the run is on. An
       `unknown` close can also mean an exit that may still land on shares no
       stop reserves, a sell standing on a book already flat, or an end state
       the broker would not show; the coverage check pages on none of them.

Safety, in the order it matters:

  * DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. `--submit` is the only way anything reaches the broker.
  * The kill switch is honoured: PAUSE_NEW still allows this pass, because
    ratcheting a stop and closing a stale position both REDUCE exposure and
    "pause new entries" is not "stop protecting what is open". FLATTEN_ALL skips
    the pass entirely — the flatten path owns the book at that point and two
    writers on the same positions is how you get a double sell. The switch is
    read again before the first write, so one flipped during the refresh
    stops the pass too.
  * A stop is only ever amended UP. `plan_actions` refuses to emit anything else.
  * A symbol whose protection is ambiguous is left alone. `stop_coverage` returns
    `indeterminate` for orders in a status it does not recognise, and acting on a
    guess there is how you end up with two stops on one lot — a short position
    waiting for a gap down.
  * A time exit releases the stop before it sells, because the stop reserves the
    shares, and only while the market is shut, when nothing but its own
    requests can move the lot: cancel, confirm the cancel, sell the holding
    read after that, verify, re-arm the stop if the sell is not working, and
    read the book once more for the verdict (`execution.protected_close`).
    Between the exit and a re-armed stop the broker's share reservation lets
    only one stand, whatever order lost replies come back in.
  * One pass time-exits at most 3 positions, or 25% of those examined if fewer
    (`position_manager.exit_budget`), so one bad input cannot liquidate the book
    through time exits in a single run. The budget is the trade date's: a pass
    run again the same day counts the exits already stamped today against it,
    and a name whose exit an earlier date queued still waits for an open is
    left to that exit, which counts against it too. That exit sells at the
    open this pass's exits queue for: a rerun past 00:00 UTC stamps the next
    date for the same open as the 22:30 run before it, and so does the run on
    a weekday exchange holiday.
    The rest are reported as deferred, keep their stops, and with --submit
    fail the pass so it pages. Stop maintenance does not count against the
    budget. A stop moved to the last price is a close all the same, so the
    claim holds for the whole pass only while the planner refuses such a
    level.
  * Nothing here opens or grows a position.

    The plan was made from the book as it stood before the pass, and a name
    planned for a time exit got no back-fill in it: the close was going to make
    one moot. A close that did not happen (refused, naked, unknown, or cut short
    by a crash between the release and the sell) leaves that name exactly where
    the back-fill exists for, and the next pass would pick it for a time exit
    again rather than cover it. So those names are planned again here, from
    positions and orders read now, under a config in which nothing is old
    enough to exit: all that can come out of it is the back-fill, placed only
    if --backfill-stops asked for back-fills at all.

    Stricter than the main pass, because a failed close is where the book is
    least settled: a name is left alone while any sell other than a working
    stop or a working take-profit still stands on it. That covers a stop still
    in `pending_cancel`, which may yet fill; one in `stopped`, whose fill is on
    its way; an exit that landed after all; a take-profit whose cancel is on
    its way. Each reserves the shares or is about to sell them, and a stop
    placed beside it is refused while the lot is held and becomes a short once
    that sell fills. Not an exit of the lot whose day is over
    (`protected_close.day_ended_exit`): a day order, it sells nothing more, and
    left standing in the count it kept the lot naked for good.

    Nor a take-profit that works: it sells only the shares it holds back, the
    broker refuses a stop on those, and the back-fill is sized off the shares
    no stop covers (`_naked_now`), so it never stands beside the take-profit on
    the same shares, as the main pass's back-fill does not. Counted as standing,
    a bracket's take-profit kept a lot added to by brackets (GOOGL: a stop on
    most of it, three one-share brackets) from its back-fill on every run: a
    share whose stop a failed close could not put back stayed without one for
    as long as the lot stayed due.

    A name whose exit was sent and never found (`unsettled`) is back-filled all
    the same, since it may never land, but through
    `protected_close.cover_beside_exit`: the exit can land beside the stop's
    POST, and the broker then lets only the first of the two stand, so the
    book is read again to say which. A name it settles either way is off
    `uncovered`.

    Every listing it reads is one that has caught up with what the closes of
    the names it was handed (`closes`) read by id (`_listing`): right after
    them, Alpaca's may still show the stops they released, or not yet the
    ones they put back. A name whose own closes it never catches up with is
    a book it could not read; the rest are re-covered off it all the same.

    Returns how many placements failed. A book it could not read, or a
