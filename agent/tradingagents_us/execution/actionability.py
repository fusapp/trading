"""Is the agent still *able* to act, or is it only able to hold?

A daily run that produces ten confident decisions and submits nothing looks
identical, from every metric this project reports, to a run that produced ten
Holds — and identical to a healthy run in the logs, because a policy refusal is
a success (`ExecutionResult.error` is False by design, see the Round-3
false-failure fix). Sharpe, drawdown and the GO verdict are all computed from
the equity curve, and a frozen book still has an equity curve: it tracks its
own marks and reports the tape's performance as the strategy's.

So the gap this module closes is not "did the strategy make money" but "did the
strategy still have a choice". Every rejected order is already persisted with
its reasons; nothing here re-derives a decision or touches the broker. It reads
order rows and answers three questions:

  * how many orders reached the broker in the window (`submitted`),
  * why the rest did not (`by_reason`, normalized so one bucket per cause),
  * how many consecutive run-days ended with zero submissions (`inert_run_days`).

`inert_run_days` counts DAYS THE AGENT RAN, not calendar days: weekends and
holidays produce no rows at all, and counting them as inert would report a
two-day inertia every Monday. A run day is a New York session date with at
least one order row — the daily run persists a row per ticker whether or not
the order was approved.

New York, not UTC: the nightly run starts at 22:30 UTC and its last councils
land after midnight UTC, so a UTC date split every run into two "run days".
Measured on the live book 2026-11-04: 18 UTC dates for 15 runs, the counter
stepping +2 every Monday (Friday's run spilled into Saturday), and the
three-run threshold firing after two. In New York time the same run ends
around 20:00 on its own session date. A run would have to last past local
midnight (5.5 h in summer, against a ~2 h norm) to be split again.
