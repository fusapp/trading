"""When to page a human about a book that has stopped acting.

`/v1/diagnostics/actionability` already answers "is the agent still able to
act". It answers it only when somebody opens the app and looks — and the whole
point of the diagnostic is that a frozen book looks healthy everywhere else, so
nobody has a reason to look. The live run went inert on 2026-08-11 and the GO
badge kept rendering for nine run days.

This module is the push side of that diagnostic: the policy that decides
whether today's report is worth waking somebody for. It is pure — no DB, no
clock, no network — so the interesting part (when NOT to send) is testable.

Three rules carry the design:

  * **'idle' never alerts.** An empty window means no order rows at all, which
    means the run did not happen. That is a scheduling failure, already owned by
    the daily-run non-zero exit and the healthchecks.io dead-man's switch.
    Reporting it here as "the strategy went quiet" blames the strategy for the
    cron, and an alert that cries about the wrong subsystem is one people learn
    to swipe away.
  * **One alert per run day, then only on escalation.** A book stuck for three
    weeks is the same news on day 4 as on day 3. Re-alert when the inertia
    deepens by `ESCALATION_STEP_RUN_DAYS`, or when the dominant blocker
    changes — a new reason is new information even at the same depth.
  * **Recovery is worth one push.** Somebody told the book is frozen has no way
    to learn it thawed; without this they either keep checking or stop trusting
    the alert. It fires once, only if we actually alerted about the freeze.
