"""Runtime circuit breakers.

Checks invoked before every trade submission. Returns False -> trade blocked.

The gates here divide into two kinds, and `check` takes a `side` because the
distinction only matters once you ask which way an order moves risk:

- **Risk-taking gates** — kill switch PAUSE_NEW, the daily drawdown halt, the
  losing streak — stop the system committing MORE capital. They are entry-side.
  Applied to an exit they invert: the account is refused the one order that
  reduces what it has at stake, at the moment it is losing money.
- **The data-sanity gate** — the price anomaly — asks whether the price in
  front of us can be trusted at all. A bad print misprices a sell as readily as
  a buy, so it runs on both sides.
- **The API error rate** is side-blind too, but inert, and nothing counts on it:
  no caller records API calls, and each ticker's trade.py is its own process
  making a handful of them, never the 21 the gate needs before it measures.
- **FLATTEN_ALL** is neither. It hands the book to execution/flatten.py, and
  while that path owns the positions a second seller is how a lot gets sold
  twice. It blocks both sides.
