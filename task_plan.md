# Autopilot backlog — Phase 7+ (eval-safe)

Survives context resets. Rule: never deploy decision-quality changes to the
eval timer until the eval window closes. Commit as Canberk, no AI attribution.
Each item: code → tests green → commit → deploy (OTA if mobile).

## EVAL CLOSED — verdict GO (2026-07-13)
Window closed at day 13/10. All hard gates passed:
Sharpe 9.91 > 1.0 · MaxDD 1.04% < 15% · +5.9% vs SPY +3.0% · Sortino 23.65.
Next phase = go-live prep (docs/go-live-checklist.md). NO real money is moved
autonomously: user must open + fund their own live Alpaca account.

### Pre-go-live safety work → branch `feat/pre-golive-safety` (NOT on main)
Round-4 items 2/3/9/6 implemented + green (192 tests) but HIGH-blast on the
live execution path. Held off main/deploy until drilled:
GATE = drill kill-switch RUN/PAUSE_NEW/FLATTEN_ALL on paper, supervised, then
merge → deploy. Undrilled execution code must not reach the running trader.

## Backlog
- [x] **1. Charts tab** — backend `/v1/prices/{ticker}` (Polygon daily bars) + mobile area/line chart (react-native-svg). OTA. ✅
- [x] **2. "Analiz Et" quick action** — portfolio positions + Charts button → deep-link Ask, auto-run. OTA. ✅
- [x] **3. Settings** — kill-switch 3-state control + backend health + last-run. OTA. ✅
- [x] **4. Eval snapshot logger** — daily equity+positions JSONL on the box (EVAL_SNAPSHOT_FILE), wired into daily_run; eval_report shows avg-positions + max-concentration. ✅
- [x] **5. Cost-opt (ADR-006)** — per-agent routing wired on branch `feat/cost-opt-adr006` (GraphSetup._pick + agent_model_map), opt-in `TRADINGAGENTS_PER_AGENT_ROUTING=1`, 93 tests green, NOT merged/deployed. ✅ branch-only

## Round 2 (eval-safe) — done
- [x] Candlestick mode toggle on Charts ✅
- [x] eval --notify push + weekly eval-report.timer (Mon 14:00 UTC) ✅
- [x] Agents tab reasoning expand + model badges ✅
- [x] /v1/eval endpoint + in-app scorecard card (Settings) ✅

## 🎯 EVAL GATE — GO confirmed (2026-07-10, day 11/10)
- day 11/10, verdict **GO**, days_remaining=0. Sharpe **7.67**, MaxDD **-1.04%**, total return **+4.03%** vs SPY +2.52% (α +1.5pt), Sortino 17.81, Calmar 163.98. All 4 hard gates green. Paper equity **$104,226** (daily +4.23%).
- Eval min-days requirement **met** → `eval_complete=true` now on /v1/eval; mobile scorecard footer reads "Eval tamamlandı · karar kesin" (deployed backend + OTA 2026-07-10).
- **STILL do not move real money automatically.** Go-live = user opens+funds live Alpaca, sets ALPACA_BASE_URL=live + live keys on the box, flips submit/routing. See docs/go-live-checklist.md.

## 🎯 EVAL GATE — GO (2026-07-09)
- /v1/eval verdict=**GO** at day 10/10 (days_remaining=0). Sharpe **9.94**, MaxDD **-1.04%**, total return **+4.55%** vs SPY +1.66% (α +2.9pt). All 4 hard gates passed. Paper account PA348DFG9628 equity **$103,643**.
- **DO NOT move real money automatically** — go-live requires the user to open + fund a live Alpaca account, set ALPACA_BASE_URL=live + live keys on the box, and flip submit/routing. See [`docs/go-live-checklist.md`](docs/go-live-checklist.md) + Deferred (go-live) below.

## Round 3 (next, eval-safe)
- [x] daily-run false-failure fix — a legitimate policy refusal (non-actionable Hold, risk guard, PDT, market closed) made `trade.py` exit rc=1 under `--submit`, so all-Hold days marked `ai-trader.service` failed + fired OnFailure push (alert fatigue, masks real broker errors). Added `ExecutionResult.error` (True only for broker/unexpected exceptions); trade.py exits non-zero only on `error`. 24 execution tests green, off-eval-path (no decision/order change), deployed 2026-07-09 ✅
- [x] eval-report false-failure fix — same anti-pattern: weekly `eval_report.py` exited rc=1 on any non-GO verdict, so during the whole open eval window (WAIT/TOO EARLY) the systemd unit showed `failed`. Verdict is data (printed + pushed via `--notify`), not job health; a real data/compute failure already raises. Now exits 0 whenever the scorecard builds; `--strict` restores the GO-only gate. 23 eval_report tests green, off-eval-path, deployed 2026-07-09 ✅
- [ ] prompt-cache markers injected into the LLM client (cache.py helpers exist) — BRANCH; needs a live API run to confirm cache hits (costs ~$1)
- [x] /v1/eval: `eval_complete` flag (days>=MIN_TRADING_DAYS) so the scorecard shows a definitive window-closed state instead of "karar penceresi açık" at days_remaining=0; read-only, off-eval-path; 7 eval-api tests green, backend deployed + OTA 2026-07-10 ✅
- [x] /v1/eval: provisional verdict ("eğilim") while TOO EARLY — projects GO/NO-GO from current Sharpe/MaxDD hard-gates ignoring the min-days req (SPY lag is a flag, not a gate); read-only reporting, off-eval-path; mobile scorecard shows trend badge next to verdict; 26 eval tests green, deployed 2026-07-07 ✅
- [x] /v1/eval: benchmark on by default so mobile scorecard + weekly push show the "Beats SPY" gate without a query param (read-only, off-eval-path); currently +3.3% vs SPY +1.6% at day 7 ✅ 2026-07-03
- [x] Portfolio: surface snapshot concentration / position-count trend — /v1/portfolio/concentration deployed 2026-06-29 (HHI, effective_n, top/top3 weight, flags, snapshot trend; read-only, off-eval-path)
- [x] Pull-to-refresh + empty states polish on Charts/Ask — Charts View→ScrollView+RefreshControl(refetch), Ask empty-state card + ticker chips; OTA preview 2026-06-30 ✅
- [x] eval_report: walk-forward holdout note when days>=60 — IS(2/3)->OOS(1/3) Sharpe split, regime-fit WARN flag; read-only, off-eval-path; 13 eval_report tests green 2026-07-01
- [x] snapshot: populate `sector` from static GICS map (sector_map.py) — display-only, off trading path; deployed + verified live 2026-07-04 ✅
- [x] E2E review critical fixes (docs/review-e2e-2026-07-04.md top-now #1/#3/#5/#7) — daily-run alerting (exit-1 + push + OnFailure unit + per-ticker timeout 1800s -k 30 + TimeoutStartSec 21600), off-box backup (private repo canberkaslan/trading-backups, deploy key, 02:15 UTC timer, sqlite online backup + snapshots + memory), preflight canary (21:45 UTC, alert-only), honest eval metrics (Sharpe/Sortino excess over FRED DGS3MO, correct Sortino downside dev, SPY total-return benchmark); adversarially reviewed (20 findings fixed pre-deploy), deployed + verified live 2026-07-04 ✅ — HEALTHCHECK_URL dead-man ping env-gated, needs healthchecks.io URL

- [x] scorecard: α vs SPY stat (portfolio return − SPY total return) as 4th grid card — makes the "Beats SPY" gate legible as a number ahead of GO/NO-GO; read-only, off-eval-path; OTA preview 2026-07-08 ✅

## Eval CLOSED 2026-07-11 — verdict GO (12/10 days; Sharpe 8.68, MaxDD 1.0%, +4.8% vs SPY +3.0%)

## Round 4 — pre-go-live hardening + mobile UI (full-system scan 2026-07-11, 41 ideas → ranked)
Eval is CLOSED: decision-path changes now allowed on main, but each HIGH-blast item gets tests + a supervised paper run first. Order matters: 6 before new screens; 2/3 before any real money.

### Critical correctness (found by scan — real bugs)
- [x] **1. PAPER/LIVE mode badge + degraded banner** (S) ✅ 2026-07-13 — trading_mode on /healthz+/readyz, StatusBanner (tri-state MOD?/PAPER/LIVE, stable height, offline after 2+ fails), hero timestamp; deployed+OTA — `trading_mode` field on /healthz (from ALPACA_BASE_URL) in agent/api/main.py; mobile health poll → /readyz (alpaca/db degraded flags); shared `<StatusBanner>` in app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx: amber PAPER / persistent red "LIVE — gerçek para" / degraded strip; last-updated ts on Portfolio hero from snapshot.timestamp_utc
- [x] **2. Kill-switch REAL wiring** (M, HIGH blast) ✅ 2026-07-13 — FileKillSwitchReader (absolute path, empty→PAUSE) in trade.py breaker; kill_check backstop in daily_run (before weekend guard, snapshot on skips); FLATTEN_ALL executes AT FLIP TIME in API w/ per-position 207 inspection (partial→fail loud); approve path gated; kill_switch_events audit; atomic writes; drilled live RUN/PAUSE/empty/garbage — FLATTEN live-fire deliberately mock-only (paper book preserved) — FileKillSwitchReader reading KILL_SWITCH_PATH (API already writes it) replaces hardcoded StaticKillSwitchReader('RUN') at agent/scripts/trade.py:216; pre-run check in daily_run.sh; FLATTEN_ALL → AlpacaClient.close_all_positions() (alpaca_broker.py:165, implemented-unreachable) + DB audit row; fail-to-PAUSE_NEW on read error; drill all 3 states on paper. Mobile switch is currently theater.
- [x] **3. Execution integrity trio** (M, HIGH blast) ✅ 2026-07-13 — stop-leg OTO without TP, gtc protective legs (day legs expired at close!), run-date idempotency key (--date threaded; post-midnight decisions can't shift it) + suffixed -rN retries + weld-free duplicates + partial-fill→NEEDS_RECONCILE; explicit status map (partially_filled→PARTIAL, stopped/suspended→NEEDS_RECONCILE); 210 tests — executor.py: (a) line 193 `if tp and sl:` drops the STOP leg when price_target missing → attach stop alone (OTO) so no naked positions (this is why live positions show stop_loss 0.0); (b) line 213 status mapping false-REJECTs `partially_filled` → explicit allowlist + NEEDS_RECONCILE; (c) derive_client_order_id from (ticker, trade_date, side) not per-run UUID + query-before-submit idempotency. test_execution.py + supervised paper run.
- [x] **8. Delete fake "Auto-execute trades" switch** (S) ✅ 2026-07-13 — honest 'Emir gönderimi' card (paper auto-submits via daily run; live→hold+approve) — settings.tsx local useState controls nothing; replace with honest read-only card "Her emir manuel onay gerektirir". If it returns, it returns as a real backend flag w/ ADR-005 gates.
- [x] **9. Honest daily P&L + intraday DD** (S) ✅ 2026-07-13 — last_equity baseline (live verify: -0.38% gerçek günlük vs eski +4.9% kümülatif yalan), 5Min portfolio_history max DD — portfolio.py:113 daily_pnl = equity−100000 (inception!) and :122 max_drawdown_today=0.0 hardcoded; parse Alpaca last_equity into Account model, daily_pnl = equity − last_equity, DD from intraday portfolio_history. Mobile renders these fields already. Bonus: last_equity is the circuit-breaker daily-DD input.
- [x] **10. Dead-man switch + preflight fix** (S) ✅ 2026-07-13 kod tarafı — EXPECTED_TRADING_MODE (preflight+secrets), OnFailure on eval-report.service, install.sh ships api+eval-report units, ping_healthcheck on kill-skip days. KALAN: healthchecks.io hesabında check açıp HEALTHCHECK_URL'i secrets.env'e koymak (user) — healthchecks.io check + HEALTHCHECK_URL into /opt/ai-trader/secrets.env (ping code shipped 07-04, never configured); OnFailure= on eval-report.service; preflight.py:37 hardcoded paper-assert → EXPECTED_TRADING_MODE env (else go-live day = false-alarm storm)

### Trust/safety UX (mobile, before real money)
- [~] **4. Approve-flow hardening** (M) — ✅ 2026-07-21 slice-1 (OTA): (a) biometric.ts OS-passcode fallback — pure `resolveAuthMode(hasHardware, getEnrolledLevelAsync)` → biometric/passcode/none; SECRET-level devices (PIN, no Face/Touch ID) no longer permanently locked out of approving; `authenticate()` returns {success, mode}, 'none' → distinct "no device lock" alert; 4 authPolicy jest tests. (b) approve/[orderId].tsx gates the false "not in pending list" on usePendingOrders.isLoading → spinner during push deep-link fetch race. (c) deleted dead "Approve (TBD)"/Reject stubs on trade/[ticker].tsx → honest read-only decision-detail note (approve happens from Orders tab). TR copy on all touched strings. 36 mobile jest green. KALAN: expo-haptics (needs native rebuild, NOT OTA-safe — deferred to next dev build) + hold-to-approve friction.
- [~] **5. Order history + fills + cancel** (M) — ✅ 2026-07-23 slice-1 (OTA, read-only): Orders tab segmented **Onay Bekleyen | Geçmiş**; consumes the orphaned `useOrders` hook (GET /v1/orders) — Geçmiş cards render broker_status (TR label + tone), fill progress (`filled_qty/quantity lot`), avg_fill_price, submitted_at. Pure helpers `utils/orders.ts` (orderStatusMeta/fillSummary/formatOrderDate — Alpaca status map, NaN clamps, UTC TR date), 14 jest green (50 total), tsc clean, TR copy sweep on tab. KALAN slice-2 (needs backend): wire api.cancelOrder (zero callers) confirm-gated + backend cancel_order persist OrderUpdate row; rejection_reasons render on rejected rows — ✅ 2026-08-03 slice-2 DONE (backend cancel rewrite + confirm-gated mobile cancel + TR rejection reasons); item 5 COMPLETE
- [~] **11. API auth hardening** (M) — ✅ 2026-07-13 core (off-eval-path, deployed): fail-closed Cognito JWT when python-jose missing (was: parse unsigned claims → forgeable `sub`; now 500 unless ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_JWT=1 for local dev); `secrets.compare_digest` on dev-bearer (timing-safe); CORS `*` → env-driven allowlist (CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS, default localhost Expo; native fetch/curl unaffected), methods/headers narrowed. 213 tests green. KALAN (deferred, higher blast/user step): rate limit /v1/* (needs slowapi + care not to throttle daily_run); rotate DEV_API_TOKEN + stop baking into public OTA bundle (per-device token / CF Access — user); notifications/test → only auth'd user's tokens
- [x] **12. Notifications inbox + contextual permission** (M) — ✅ 2026-08-01 (OTA): zustand store `stores/notifications.ts` persisted via **expo-secure-store** (AsyncStorage would need a native rebuild → not OTA-safe), fed by BOTH `addNotificationReceivedListener` (foreground) and the tap handler (tap copy filed as read); bell + unread badge in the shared `StatusBanner` (inside the 24pt strip, hitSlop→44pt target) → new `app/notifications.tsx` history screen, rows deep-link via the SAME `routeForType` the tap handler uses (single source of truth, can't drift), open = markAllRead + `setBadgeCountAsync(0)`, confirm-gated Temizle. Permission moved off startup: `syncPushTokenIfGranted()` (silent, no prompt) at boot; the OS prompt now fires from the Settings row (live permission status + inbox link, TR copy) or `maybeAskForPush()` on the first pending order (once/session, explained first) — a cold-start denial is permanent and would mean never seeing an approval alert again. Pure helpers `utils/inbox.ts` (routeForType, toInboxItem w/ truncation, mergeInbox dedup that never resurrects a read row, UTF-8-aware byte-budget serializeInbox, tolerant parseInbox, TR relative dates, badgeLabel 9+), 27 new jest (117 total), tsc no new errors, 213 backend tests green. Read-only, off-eval-path.

### Mobile UI polish (the "arayüz" work)
- [~] **6. Design-system extraction FIRST** (M) — ✅ 2026-07-14 first slice (OTA preview): `src/components/ErrorState` (retry-wired via refetch) + `EmptyState` extracted; Portfolio/Orders/Agents inline "Backend unreachable"+empty blocks replaced → dev-CLI leaks GONE (uvicorn / `python -m scripts.trade` no longer shown to users), dead `notional` proxy + now-unused styles dropped, honest TR copy. KALAN: Card, Stat, RatingBadge, Skeleton (kills bare "Loading…"); raw hexes → theme/colors.ts. ✅ 2026-07-17 slice: Money done — `src/utils/format.ts` (formatUsd/formatPct single source), 3 formatUsd + 2 formatPct copies killed (orders/portfolio/approve), negative sign outside $, `signed` opt replaces inline `>=0?'+'` P&L patterns, null/NaN→em-dash; wired the dead `test:jest` script (jest.config.js jest-expo preset + babel.config.js), 7 format tests green; OTA preview.
- [~] **7. Home dashboard: equity curve + drawdown** (M) — 2026-07-18 slice-1 SHIPPED (OTA): wrapped GET /v1/portfolio/history (usePortfolioHistory), portfolio.tsx now renders OTA-safe RN-View equity area chart w/ worst-DD annotation + GO/NO-GO verdict hero badge (pure helpers utils/equity.ts, jest 18 tests). 2026-07-19 slice-2 SHIPPED (OTA): period selector 1M/3M/6M (PERIODS const drives usePortfolioHistory+useEval+refresh invalidation; backend forwards to Alpaca, EVAL_START_DATE trims — windows currently coincide, diverge past 1mo) + drawdown ribbon under the curve (ddIntensity pure helper, cells tinted by relative DD depth; 5 new jest tests, 23 green). 2026-07-20 slice-3 SHIPPED (OTA): SPY overlay + α chip — usePrices('SPY', PERIOD_DAYS[period]) forwarded to EquityChart; rebaseSpy anchors SPY closes to portfolio start-equity + trims to equity window, combinedScale prevents overlay clipping, spyReturnPct/alphaPct pure helpers; dotted SPY markers per date-aligned column + Portföy/SPY legend + α chip (green/red, hidden when benchmark null); 7 new jest tests, 32 green. Item 7 home dashboard COMPLETE.
- [~] Quick UI wins: ✅ 2026-07-24 WCAG contrast (OTA) — textMuted #666 (3.4:1, AA fail) → #949494 (5.0:1 lightest surface, 6.5:1 background); added utils/contrast.ts (WCAG luminance/ratio helpers) + guard test asserting every text token clears AA on all 3 backgrounds + regression check that #666 fails; 64 jest green, tsc clean on touched files. KALAN: tab bar icons + userInterfaceStyle 'dark' (NATIVE, not OTA — light-mode device → white tab bar under dark screens bug); 44pt touch targets + accessibilityLabels on money actions; render already-fetched debate_transcript/take_profit/tokens_in/out+latency on trade/[ticker] + agents; sortino/calmar on scorecard; sector card from Position.sector + /v1/portfolio/concentration wrap

- [~] Quick UI wins cont.: ✅ 2026-07-25 trade/[ticker] detail (OTA) — the "Tam detay →" link from Agents now actually shows full detail: per-agent reasoning cards (model badge + tokens_in↓/out↑ + latency via `utils/decision.ts` formatTokens/formatLatency), debate_transcript rendered in debate-flow order (debateEntries sorts bull→bear→…→PM, drops blank roles, debateRoleLabel title-cases), added the previously-dropped `take_profit` alongside price_target, money via formatUsd, bare English "Loading…"/"Back" → TR ("Yükleniyor…"/"Geri") + honest "Karar bulunamadı." empty state; 13 new jest (77 total), tsc clean on touched files. All already-fetched fields — read-only, off-eval-path.

- [~] Quick UI wins cont.: ✅ 2026-07-26 Portfolio risk & sector-allocation card (OTA) — wraps GET /v1/portfolio/concentration (useConcentration hook + Concentration type) into a Risk & Dağılım card on portfolio.tsx: diversification badge from effective_n, top-name + top3 weights (toned vs the 10% single-name cap), >10% flag count; sector split derived locally from snapshot Position.sector (market-value weighted, GICS→short TR labels, cash as remainder) rendered as horizontal weight bars. Pure helpers utils/concentration.ts (sectorLabelTr/sectorAllocation/topWeightTone/diversificationLabel), 13 new jest (90 total), tsc clean on touched files. Read-only, off-eval-path. KALAN: tab bar icons + userInterfaceStyle 'dark' (NATIVE); 44pt touch targets + accessibilityLabels on money actions.

### Round 4 later (post-go-live)
- [x] **Fill reconciliation + realized P&L ledger** ✅ 2026-08-09 — see the daily-loop entry below.
      Reflection memory on realized fills is now UNBLOCKED (closed_trades is the input).
- [x] **Sizer has no cash / buying-power cap** (found 2026-08-09). ✅ DONE in 6ebafe5 (`apply_cash_cap`, BUY-only, step 3b in sizer.py) — item was left open by mistake; closed 2026-10-01. `size_from_decision` sizes off
      `account_equity` only (sizer.py:98), so a fully-invested long book drifts into margin as it
      appreciates — the paper account sits at cash **-$510.54** on $109,574 equity (0.47% levered).
      Harmless on paper; on a funded live account that is real leverage plus margin interest, and
      nothing in the risk stack currently refuses it. Fix = cap notional at min(equity·pct, cash) or
      an explicit `MAX_GROSS_EXPOSURE_PCT`. Decision-path change → tests + supervised run. This is
      why `assert acct.cash >= 0` no longer lives in test_dataflows_smoke.py.
- Circuit breaker real inputs (5/7 gates placeholder-fed) — first supervised live week, uses last_equity from #9
- Position detail screen + per-ticker history from snapshot JSONL; kill-switch audit trail + header pill (after #2); LLM cost panel (after pipeline.py tokens_in/out=0 stub fix); TR-primary language sweep; paper lane as permanent staging (templated units + EXPECTED_ALPACA_ACCOUNT interlock); ws.ts is implemented-unused (+ close() reconnect bug) — decide: wire realtime or delete; ~~backup restore drill~~ ✅ 2026-10-16 (`scripts/restore_drill.py`, docs/restore-drill.md; weekly timer 10-17); secrets → /etc/ai-trader/
- Dropped: /v1/limits risk panel (protection theater until real caps merge)

## Deferred (go-live)
- HTTPS (cloudflared/caddy) — needs domain decision; low risk on paper.
- Merge `feat/cost-opt-adr006` + flip routing flag — eval window now CLOSED. Branch rebased
  clean on today's main, 167 tests green, default-OFF proven. Merge + flag-flip left for human
  (go-live decision) — see [docs/cost-opt-merge-readiness.md](docs/cost-opt-merge-readiness.md).
  Blocker before flip: refresh stale model IDs (opus-4-7/sonnet-4-6 → 4.8/5).

## Done (2026-06-24)
- accumulation fix, universe 3→11, clean book, timeout 150min
- 7a eval scorecard, 7b /analyze, 7c Ask tab + OTA
- 7e Charts, 7f Analiz-Et deep-link, 7g Settings kill-switch+health, snapshot logger
- cost-opt routing on branch (opt-in, not deployed)

## Daily loop 2026-10-01 (🔴 BROKER 401 18. gün; box 77 commit geride ve pull'u tek blok)
- **Canlı durum alınamadı.** trader-stg: `/readyz` degraded `alpaca:false`, `/v1/eval` 500, snapshot 502
  (box 4ec0472). `trader.fusapp.com` başka origin (`alpaca:true`, dev token 401).
- [x] **`docs/box-catchup-2026-10-01.md`**: 77 commit blast-radius'a göre 4 kovaya ayrıldı
  (A execution/risk 16, B decision-quality 12, C read-only API/monitoring 14, D UI/CI/docs).
  Key rotate = yeni kodu açan şalter → sıra: #52 kapat/revert → key hâlâ 401'ken pull → install.sh +
  `User=ubuntu` sed + eval-report.timer → key rotate → ilk koşuyu canlı izle. Doğrulananlar:
  15bf661 revert'i main'de temiz uygulanıyor; 4ec0472'ye e364701+94e71f8 temiz, f007e0b
  `risk.py`'de çakışıyor (stop-coverage route box'ta yok). Box'ta `eval-report.timer` aktif değil.
- [x] Backlog'daki "Sizer cash cap" maddesi 6ebafe5'te zaten yapılmıştı → kapatıldı.
- **Sıradaki:** (a) Alpaca paper key rotate = Canberk, (b) #52 ambiguous-state tasarımı (branch) veya
  revert kararı, (c) pull'dan önce bucket-C deploy branch'i seçeneği.

## Daily loop 2026-09-28 (🔴 BROKER 401 15. gün; backtest motoru çok-isimli portföyü ticker ortalamasıyla skorluyormuş)
- **Canlı durum alınamadı (broker 401, gün 15).** trader-stg: `/readyz` degraded `alpaca:false`,
  `/v1/eval` **500**, snapshot **502** (box hâlâ eski commit'te — 503 mapping'i deploy edilmedi).
  `trader.fusapp.com` başka origin'e gidiyor (`alpaca:true`, dev token "invalid token").
- [x] **`summary_stats` mean-aggregation'ı ölçüldü ve düzeltildi** (09-09'daki yan bulgu (d)).
  Ungrouped çok kolonlu `vbt.Portfolio` = N bağımsız tek-isim defteri; düz `stats()` her metriği
  ticker'lar arasında **ortalıyor**. 3 isimlik seed'li kitapta ölçüm:
  | metrik | raporlanan (mean) | gerçek kitap (summed equity) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Sharpe | −0.21 | −0.57 |
  | MaxDD % | 17.6 | 12.7 |
  | Total Trades | 9.67 | 29 |
  Sharpe ~2.8× daha "iyi" görünüyordu. Fix: `engine.portfolio_stats()` → `stats(group_by=True)`
  (equity_curve ile aynı toplam eğri); `BacktestResult.stats` de artık aynı kaynaktan.
- [x] **Annualization 365 → 252.** vectorbt default `year_freq="365 days"`; business-day bar'larda
  Sharpe'ı √(365/252) ≈ **1.20×** şişiriyor, ve bu sayılar canlı gate'e (Sharpe>1.0, 252 bazlı)
  karşı okunuyor. `TRADING_YEAR="252 days"` motorda sabitlendi.
  2 yeni offline test (hand-computed Sharpe/MaxDD/trade sayısına karşı + "Aggregating using"
  uyarısı yok); eski motorda ikisi de KIRMIZI, yenide yeşil. 1230 passed; 2 fail =
  `test_dataflows_smoke` canlı Alpaca **401** (log'da doğrulandı, beklenen). Ruff temiz.
  Deploy YOK/gerek yok — backtest kodu, karar ve eval yolunda çalışmıyor.
- [x] **`backtest/run.py` + `backtest/optimize.py` de 252 bazlı (2026-09-29).** İkisi de
  `pf.sharpe_ratio(year_freq=TRADING_YEAR)` çağırıyor. Test elle hesaplanmış günlük-getiri Sharpe'ına
  karşı (vbt'ye karşı değil); eski kodda KIRMIZI (−2.10 vs −1.74 = 1.20×), yenide yeşil.
  Yan bulgu: `test_commentator_ingest::test_no_youtube_key_is_a_logged_skip` tam suite'te düşüyordu —
  başka bir test `agent/.env`'i `os.environ`'a yüklüyor, gerçek `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` sızıyor (tek
  başına geçiyor, CI'da .env yok). Test artık iki env'i `monkeypatch.delenv` ile temizliyor.

## Daily loop 2026-09-09 (🟢 BOX GERİ DÖNDÜ; "S3'te düşüyor, normal" dediğimiz test 16 gündür başka bir şeyde düşüyormuş)
- **Box canlı, 16 günlük karanlık bitti.** `trader.fusapp.com` cevap veriyor: `/healthz` ok
  (`trading_mode: paper`), `/readyz` `alpaca:true db:true`. Ajan **08-09'da koşmuş** — DB'de
  2026-09-08 tarihli taze UNH kararı var (Overweight, entry 398.5, stop 370.0), yani günlük döngü
  kendi kendine yeniden başlamış. Portföy (06:22 UTC snapshot): equity **$109,273.74**, cash
  $2,829.16, 10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$10,214.99**, günlük **−$601.80 / −%0.55**, intraday DD
  −%0.65, gross exposure %97.4, 5 isim %10 tek-isim tavanının üstünde.
  **SSH hâlâ kapalı** — 22/80/443 hepsi filtreli, ICMP %100 kayıp; sadece cloudflared tüneli
  (outbound) ayakta. Yani **deploy bugün mümkün değil**, ve stop backfill / reconcile hâlâ bekliyor.
- [x] 🔴 **`import vectorbt` aylardır patlıyormuş ve tam da onu yakalayacak test rutin olarak
  deselect ediliyormuş** — vectorbt metadata'sında `plotly>=4.12.0` var, üst sınır yok; ama kendi
  `_settings.py`'ı plotly'nin **6.0'da kaldırdığı** `scattermapbox` trace'ini isimlendiriyor.
  Temiz bir resolve plotly 7.0.0 çekiyor → `backtest/run.py`, `backtest/optimize.py` ve
  `tradingagents_us/backtest/engine.py` **üçü de import anında** `ValueError` atıyor.
  - **Neden 16 gün görünmedi — ölçüldü, tahmin değil:** bunu görecek tek test
    `test_synthetic_sma_crossover_on_aapl_2024`, ve günlük döngü talimatı onu
    *"S3 yüzünden local'de fail, CI'da skip — normal"* diye deselect ettiriyor. Bugün deselect'siz
    koşturdum: **S3'e hiç gelmiyordu**, `import vectorbt` satırında ölüyordu. CI'da da yakalanmıyor,
    çünkü orada `AWS_PROFILE` yok → test **skip** oluyor → vectorbt hiç import edilmiyor.
    Yani açıklama semptomu kapatmış: yanlış gerekçeyle susturulan bir test, ikinci ve alakasız bir
    kırığı taşıyordu.
  - **Fix:** `agent/pyproject.toml`'a `"plotly>=5.24,<6"` + gerekçe yorumu (sınır bize ait, çünkü
    upstream'in metadata'sı yanlış). `uv lock` → plotly 7.0.0 → 5.24.1; başka hiçbir paket runtime'da
    plotly istemiyor (scikit-learn sadece `docs`/`examples` extra'sında).
  - **Kanıt:** `import vectorbt` OK; `python -m backtest.run --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-12-31`
    uçtan uca koştu (momentum_6m −0.13 / mean_reversion_rsi 0.65 / ma_crossover 0.56 Sharpe,
    SPY buy&hold 2.30 — yani 2024'te üç baseline de SPY'ın çok altında, ayrı bir konu).
    S3 testi artık **belgelenen sebeple** düşüyor: `InvalidAccessKeyId` (creds gerçekten geçersiz).
- [x] **Motor sinyali artık bir credential'ın arkasında değil** — `tests/test_backtest_engine_offline.py`:
  elle kurulmuş deterministik down→up→down serisi üzerinde 10/30 SMA crossover; S3 yok, ağ yok,
  anahtar yok. 4 test: (a) temiz bir interpreter'da `import` (subprocess — pytest zaten import
  ettiği için in-process assert soğuk resolve'u kanıtlamaz), (b) tamamlanmış round-trip + her
  headline metrik finite (NaN burada asıl failure mode: vectorbt hiç pozisyon açmayınca raise
  etmiyor, NaN dönüyor), (c) yön kontrolü (%75'lik rally bacağında long olan strateji zarar
  edemez; fee/slippage internals'ını pinlememek için kasıtlen zayıf), (d) shape mismatch guard.
  **Ayrı dosyada, bilerek:** mevcut deselect tek bir test id'sini adlandırıyor ama
  `--deselect tests/test_backtest_engine.py` bütün dosyayı götürürdü ve bu kontrol ondan sağ çıkmalı.
  **687 test yeşil** (683 + 4), ruff temiz, mypy'de yeni hata yok (109 pre-existing, dokunmadığım
  dosyalarda).
- **Yan bulgu (fix EDİLMEDİ, backlog'a):** `engine.summary_stats` çok kolonlu bir portföyde
  vectorbt'nin `stats()`'ını **sessizce ticker'lar arasında mean'liyor** ("Object has multiple
  columns. Aggregating using mean" uyarısı her koşuda çıkıyor). Tek isimlik testte zararsız, ama
  bir universe backtest'inde "portföyün Sharpe'ı" diye raporlanan sayı aslında **per-ticker Sharpe
  ortalaması** — bu ikisi aynı şey değil. Ölçülmeden düzeltilmemeli.
- **DEPLOY YOK — iki sebeple.** (1) SSH kapalı, box'a erişim yok. (2) Zaten gerek yok: değişiklik
  dependency pin + test, karar yolunda ve eval yolunda hiçbir şey çalıştırmıyor; laptop/CI tarafı.
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box'un inbound'unu açmak = Canberk (Hetzner firewall / nftables — tünel ayakta,
  yani kutu sağ), (b) SSH dönünce reconcile + stop backfill (265 çıplak hisse) ve `git pull` ile
  bugünün pin'ini box'a taşımak, (c) `backtest/data.py` → `survivor_prices` geçişi — artık
  `run.py`/`optimize.py` gerçekten koştuğu için geçiş **doğrulanabilir** hale geldi (dün mümkün
  değildi, ikisi de import'ta ölüyordu), (d) `summary_stats` mean-aggregation'ını ölçmek,
  (e) 6-bracket survivorship tablosunu commit'li, seed'li bir script'le yeniden üretmek.

## Daily loop 2026-09-08 (🔴 BOX DARK 15. gün; survivorship sayacı kendi yazım hatamızı sayıyormuş)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 15. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → CF **1033**, SSH 22 timeout, %100 ICMP
  kaybı. Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only): equity **$109,875.54**, last_equity aynı (günlük **$0.00**),
  cash $2,829.16, 10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$10,816.79**, net **+$9,875.54 / +9.88%**. Son fill hâlâ
  **08-24 META** — kitap 15 gündür yönetilmiyor. Stop coverage değişmedi: **265/339 çıplak (%78.2)**.
- [x] 🔴 **`survivor_prices` iki ismi delisting sanıyordu; biri hayatta** (commit `eb338ee`).
  Dünkü koşu "2 sembol fiyatlanamadı: BF-B, MRSH" dedi ve ikisini de **survivorship sayacına** yazdı.
  BF-B = Brown-Forman, yaşıyor, Polygon'da **BF.B** altında 1083 bar. `sp500_history` sınıf hisselerini
  `.`→`-` çeviriyor (satır 105/204) çünkü Wikipedia/yfinance öyle yazıyor; Polygon nokta kullanıyor.
  Yani bu modülün **dürüst raporlamak için var olduğu tek sayı**, bir yazım kuralı yüzünden şişmiş.
  - **Neden görünmedi — bugün ölçüldü:** aggregates endpoint'i hiç "hayır" demiyor. `BF-B` ve `MRSH`
    ikisi de **HTTP 200, `status: OK`, 0 sonuç** — birbirinden ve gerçekten geçmişi biten bir
    şirketten **ayırt edilemez**. Reference endpoint ayırıyor ama modülün beklemediği şekilde:
    `BF-B`/`BRK-B` → **HTTP 400** (parse edilemeyen sembol), `MRSH` → temiz **404** (sembol var,
    kimse tutmamış). `read_issuer` sadece 404 bekliyordu, **400 raise ediyordu** → tek bir sınıf
    hissesi 500 isimlik bir universe koşusunu o satıra mal olmak yerine **komple düşürüyordu**.
  - `polygon_candidates` orijinal yazımdan **sonra** nokta formunu öneriyor, yalnızca sondaki 1-2
    harflik sınıf eki için — warrant/unit eki tahmine açılmıyor, ve caller'ın istediği yazım her
    zaman önce deneniyor. `resolve_symbol` bir adayı ancak provider **bir issuer adlandırırsa**
    kabul ediyor (modüldeki her probe'un geçmek zorunda olduğu aynı çıta).
  - **Mevcut bir kural az kalsın kırılıyordu, test yakaladı:** probe'lar provider'ın bar döndürdüğü
    günlere clamp'li (yoksa ilk bardan önceki bir lookup hayali issuer değişimi uyduruyor). Bu yüzden
    çözümleme yalnızca **birden fazla adayı olan** ticker'lar için önden koşuyor; boş yolda clamp'lenecek
    bar zaten yok, dolayısıyla lookup oraya taşındı — ve delisting'i yazım hatasından ayırabildiği
    **tek an** orası.
  - `Coverage.provider_symbol` + `unlisted`, `usable`'dan **ayrı** raporlanıyor. `unlisted` için iki
    şart da gerekiyor: **SIVB** 200 bar döndürüp okunabilir issuer vermiyor — o provider geçmişinde
    gerçek bir boşluk, bizim yazım hatamız değil, ve survivorship sayacında **kalmalı**.
  - **Canlı doğrulama:** BF-B ve BRK-B artık **1083'er bar**, MRSH sayacın dışında, TWTR/SIVB/INFO
    sınırları hâlâ **2022-10-27 / 2023-03-09 / 2022-02-25** gerçek corporate action'larında. 12 yeni
    test (**611 yeşil**), ruff temiz.
- **Dünkü tabloya etkisi — sınırlandı, ölçüldü:** 2021-09-03 üyeliğinde tireli **yalnız 2 isim** var
  (`BF-B`, `BRK-B`) ve **ikisi de survivor**; 82 leaver'ın **hiçbiri** tireli değil. Yani dünkü
  tablonun **leaver kolu etkilenmemiş** (kanıtlı). Survivor kolu 424'ten 82 çekmişti, dolayısıyla en
  fazla 2 çekiliş sessizce düşmüş olabilir (beklenen ≈0.4 isim). Ölçülen +0.8…+3.6pp bias'ın yanında
  gürültü, ve survivors-only kolundan isim düşmesi bias'ın **işaretini** sistematik olarak
  değiştirmez. Dünkü seed'li örneklem ad-hoc'tu, repo'da script'i yok → kesin çekiliş listesi
  yeniden üretilemiyor; bu yüzden "etkilenmedi" değil, **"etkisi ≤2 survivor draw ile sınırlı"** diyorum.
- **DEPLOY YOK — bilinçli.** Off-decision-path, off-eval-path; laptop'tan koşan analiz aracı, canlı
  yolda hiçbir şey çalıştırmıyor. Box dönünce de deploy edilecek bir şey yok.
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) box dönünce reconcile + stop backfill (265 çıplak
  hisse), (d) `backtest/data.py`'ı survivor_prices'a geçirmek (hâlâ yfinance; run.py + optimize.py
  onu kullanıyor → aynı recycle tuzağı orada duruyor) — artık altındaki loader'ın sayacı doğru
  olduğu için güvenle yapılabilir, (f) dünkü 6-bracket tablosunu seed'i **commit edilmiş** bir
  script'le yeniden üretmek (tekrarlanabilirlik; bugünkü "yeniden üretemiyorum" durumu bir daha olmasın).

## Daily loop 2026-09-07 (🔴 BOX DARK 14. gün; DÜNKÜ "dar stop kötü" BULGUSU TERSİNE DÖNDÜ)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 14. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → CF **1033**, SSH 22 timeout, ICMP yok.
  Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only): equity **$109,875.54**, last_equity aynı (hafta sonu → günlük
  **$0.00**), cash $2,829.16, buying_power $311,046.50, 10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$10,816.79**,
  net vs 100k **+$9,875.54 / +9.88%**, ACTIVE, `trading_blocked=false`. Son fill hâlâ **08-24 META**
  — kitap 14 gündür yönetilmiyor. Dünkü sayılarla birebir aynı (piyasa kapalı).
- [x] 🔴 **`backtest/survivor_prices.py` — survivorship-safe FİYAT katmanı** (commit `6037f0e`).
  `dataflows/sp500_history.py` point-in-time üyeliği zaten kuruyordu; eksik olan o isimleri
  **fiyatlamak**tı. Ve mevcut `backtest/data.py`'a bağlamak delisted isimleri kaybetmekten
  **daha kötü** bir şey yapıyor. Canlı key'lerle bugün ölçüldü:
  - **yfinance**: 16 delisted S&P ismi (TWTR, ATVI, SIVB, CERN, XLNX, VMW, SPLK, PXD, CTXS, NLSN,
    ABMD, SGEN, HZNP, MXIM, ALXN, DISCA) → **0 satır**. Ama **SBNY 345 satır** (2024-08'den) ve
    **INFO 306 satır** (2024-10'dan) döndü. Signature Bank 2023 Mart'ta el konuldu, IHS Markit
    2022 Şubat'ta S&P Global'e katıldı — bu barlar **o dört harfi şimdi kim tutuyorsa ona ait**
    (INFO bugün bir ETF). Loader "SBNY: 345 bar" diyor ve çıktısında bunu söyleyen hiçbir şey yok.
  - **Polygon**: delisted geçmişi var, ama plan penceresiyle **kesişen** aralığı sessizce kırpıyor.
    Tamamen dışarıdaki aralık dürüstçe `NOT_AUTHORIZED`; kesişen aralık **HTTP 200 + kırpılmış veri**.
    TWTR 2018-01-01→2022-10-27 istendi, 2021-09-08'den başlayan 288 bar geldi, bayrak yok. Plan
    penceresi ölçüldü: **2021-09-03** (5 yıllık kayan pencere). Repo'daki her backtest 2018-2025
    konfigüre — yani sessiz versiyon **her seferinde** tetiklenen versiyon.
  - **Guard**: bar'lar, pencere başında ticker'ı tutan issuer'a kısıtlanıyor; kimlik = Polygon
    point-in-time reference'ın **CIK**'i (bir recycle'ın koruyamayacağı tek alan; isimler
    re-brand/share-class yüzünden masumca kayar, isim karşılaştırmak bunları recycle sanardı).
    Ticker başına **iki dışa doğru binary search**; arama yalnızca provider'ın pozitif olarak
    doğruladığı bir günü döndürüyor — bilinmeyen bir orta nokta ya bir tarafa atanmıyor, sınırı
    geri çekiyor. İki `unknown` **asla eşit değil**, yani okunamayan ticker guard'a takılıyor,
    guard'dan geçmiyor. Canlı sınırların hepsi gerçek corporate action'a oturdu: **SBNY 2023-03-10,
    SIVB 2023-03-09, INFO 2022-02-25, ATVI 2023-10-12, TWTR 2022-10-27**. Guard bugünkü indeksin
    **içinde** de bir recycle yakaladı: **DOC** (Physicians Realty → 2024'te ticker Healthpeak'e
    geçti, 459 bar).
  - Yazarken bir bug yakalandı ve düzeltildi: uzak uç `unknown` olduğunda extension hiç
    çalışmıyordu; Polygon'un **güncel** SBNY satırında CIK yok ama point-in-time satırları
    Signature Bank'i 2023-03-13'e kadar kanıtlıyor — guard 379 barlık kanıtlı aralığı **1 güne**
    düşürüyordu. Artık okunabilir yakın uç, uzak uç okunamasa da uzatılıyor.
  - 23 test (**601 yeşil**), ruff 0.16.4 temiz, provider'lar inject edilebilir (test'te network yok).
- [x] 🔴 **DÜNKÜ "Sonuç 2 — dar stop en kötü şekil" SURVIVORSHIP ARTIFACT'İ ÇIKTI.**
  Kontrollü ölçüm: `members_as_of(2021-09-03)` = 506 isim, bunların **82'si** bugünkü indekste yok.
  Örneklem = 82 leaver + 82 seed'li rastgele survivor (aynı evren, aynı pencere 2021-09→2025-12,
  aynı bracket, aynı loader) — tek değişen, leaver'ların dahil olup olmadığı. **82 leaver'ın hepsi
  Polygon'da fiyatlanabildi** (0 kayıp; yfinance'te 82'sinin çoğu 0 satırdı).

  | Bracket | survivor-safe edge | survivors-only edge | survivorship | per-trade fark |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | −3% / +6% | **+3.4pp** | +4.2pp | +0.8pp | +$20 |
  | −5% / +10% | −0.1pp | +0.9pp | +1.0pp | +$22 |
  | −8% / +16% | **−2.1pp** | +1.5pp | **+3.6pp** | **+$111** |
  | −5% / +15% | −0.2pp | +2.0pp | +2.2pp | +$65 |
  | −10% / +10% | −3.2pp | −1.5pp | +1.7pp | +$33 |
  | −3% / +12% | +1.1pp | +1.9pp | +0.8pp | +$22 |

  - **Bias her bracket'te pozitif** (+0.8…+3.6pp) — yani survivor evreninde her çıkış şekli
    olduğundan iyi görünüyor. Beklenen kısım bu.
  - **Beklenmeyen kısım: bias üniform değil ve tam da dünkü sonucun yaşadığı yerde en büyük.**
    Dün "geniş stop çok daha iyi" idi (−8%: +17.8pp vs −3%: +4.2pp). Survivorship-safe evrende
    **−8%/+16% edge NEGATİF (−2.1pp)** ve **−3%/+6% altı şeklin en iyisi (+3.4pp)**. Sıralama
    **tersine dönüyor**. Mekanizma mantıklı: geniş stop ancak gerçekten kötü bir harekette
    tetiklenir, ve gerçekten kötü hareketi yaşayan isimler tam olarak indeksten **düşen** isimler.
    Survivor evreninde o hareketler tanım gereği toparlanmış oluyor, dolayısıyla geniş stop en çok
    survivorship'i emiyor (+3.6pp / +$111).
  - **Bu, decision-path'e girmek üzere olan bir bulguydu.** Dünkü "sıradaki (c) stop-loss alt sınırı
    tartışması" doğrudan bu bulgudan doğuyordu — yani bir survivorship artifact'i üzerine kurulmuş
    bir risk parametresi değişikliği olacaktı. **Madde (c) düşürüldü.**
  - **Dünkü Sonuç 1 ayakta**: çıkış *yapısı* kaybettiren şey değil — ama artık "her şekilde edge
    pozitif" demiyoruz; survivorship-safe evrende altı şeklin **dördü negatif**. Doğru okuma:
    golden-cross girişi + sabit bracket kombinasyonunun bu evrende anlamlı bir edge'i yok, ve
    canlı ledger'daki −$293 hâlâ 3 işlemin sonucu, bir stop bulgusu değil.
  - **CAVEAT (dürüstlük payı):** dünkü koşu 2018–2025 / 10 mega-cap, bugünkü 2021-09→2025 / 164
    karma isim. İki koşu arasındaki **mutlak** fark yalnız survivorship değil, pencere+evren
    farkını da içeriyor. Ama tabloda karşılaştırılan iki sütun **aynı pencere, aynı örneklem
    kurgusu, aynı loader** — survivorship'i temiz izole eden ölçüm o sütun farkı, ve sıralamanın
    tersine dönmesi de o kontrollü ölçümün içinde.
- **DEPLOY YOK — bilinçli ve gerekli değil.** Off-decision-path, off-eval-path; canlı yolda hiçbir
  şey çalıştırmıyor, box dönünce de deploy edilecek bir şey yok (laptop'tan koşan analiz aracı).
- **Canberk'e kalan (değişmedi):** (1) Hetzner konsolu → box'a bak, ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` +
  `journalctl -b -1 -e`, değilse power-cycle; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api`, `cloudflared`.
  (2) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups Contents:read PAT).
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) box dönünce reconcile + stop backfill (265 çıplak
  hisse), (c) ~~stop-loss alt sınırı~~ **DÜŞTÜ** — dayandığı bulgu survivorship çıktı,
  (d) `backtest/data.py`'ın kendisini survivor_prices'a geçirmek (şu an hâlâ yfinance; llm_backtest
  ve engine onu kullanıyor, yani aynı recycle tuzağı orada duruyor), (e) 2 sembol formatı
  fiyatlanamadı (BF-B, MRSH — Polygon `BF.B` kullanıyor) → ticker normalizasyonu.

## Daily loop 2026-09-06 (🔴 BOX DARK 13. gün; n=8 problemi backtest'te ölçüldü)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 13. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → CF **1033**, SSH 22 timeout. Kurtarma
  hâlâ Hetzner konsolu = Canberk. Backend deploy imkânsız. Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only):
  equity **$109,875.54**, last_equity aynı (hafta sonu → günlük **$0.00**), cash $2,829.16,
  buying_power $311,046.50, 10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$10,816.79**, net vs 100k **+$9,875.54 /
  +9.88%**, ACTIVE, `trading_blocked=false`. Son fill hâlâ **08-24 META** — kitap 13 gündür
  yönetilmiyor. Watchdog relay zinciri sağlam (incident #1 gövdesi `05:42Z`).
- [x] 🔴 **08-14'ten beri "NO-GO kök nedeni" diye taşınan stop bulgusu ÇÜRÜDÜ: n=3 gürültüydü.**
  `tradingagents_us/backtest/exit_paths.py` + `scripts/exit_path_backtest.py` (saf modül +
  read-only CLI; broker yok, DB yok, **box gerektirmiyor**). Canlı bracket'in *şeklini* —
  fill'den sabit uzaklıkta bir stop bacağı + bir take-profit bacağı — deterministik bir giriş
  sinyaline takıp 2018–2025 günlük barları üzerinde replay ediyor ve sonucu **`exit_quality`'nin
  kendi roll-up'larıyla** puanlıyor (ikinci bir "win rate" implementasyonu er geç ledger'la
  strateji dışı sebeplerle çelişirdi). Canlı defterdeki 8 strateji çıkışı yerine **~200 pozisyon**:

  | Bracket (stop / hedef) | n | hit rate | payoff (gerçekleşen / istenen) | breakeven | edge | işlem başına |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | −3% / +6% | 206 | 38.3% | 1.93 / 2.00 | 34.1% | **+4.2pp** | +$72 |
  | −5% / +10% | 196 | 44.9% | 1.72 / 2.00 | 36.8% | **+8.1pp** | +$220 |
  | −8% / +16% | 153 | 55.6% | 1.65 / 2.00 | 37.8% | **+17.8pp** | +$748 |
  | −5% / +15% | 190 | 38.4% | 2.43 / 3.00 | 29.1% | **+9.3pp** | +$318 |
  | −10% / +10% | 152 | 69.1% | 0.81 / 1.00 | 55.4% | **+13.7pp** | +$534 |
  | −3% / +12% | 204 | 27.9% | 3.12 / 4.00 | 24.3% | **+3.7pp** | +$91 |

  - **Sonuç 1 — çıkış YAPISI kaybettiren şey değil.** Denenen her bracket şeklinde edge pozitif.
    Yani canlı ledger'daki −$293'lük strateji sonucu "stop mantığı bozuk"un kanıtı değil; 3
    işlemin kanıtı. **Karar: exit mantığına dokunulmayacak** (zaten decision-path, eval kuralı da
    bunu yasaklıyor) — 08-14'ten beri açık duran (b) maddesi böylece kapanıyor.
  - **Sonuç 2 — asıl sinyal: DAR stop en kötü şekil.** −3% stop edge +3.7…+4.2pp / işlem başına
    $72–91; −8% stop edge +17.8pp / $748. Hit rate 38.3% → 55.6%'ya çıkıyor: dar stop trend
    başlamadan whipsaw'da kesiyor. Canlı sistemde `stop_loss`'u **LLM Trader** seçiyor ve hiçbir
    alt sınır yok — bu, karar kalitesine dokunmadan konuşulabilecek gerçek bir parametre sorusu.
  - **Sonuç 3 — gap maliyeti ölçüldü: istenen payoff asla alınmıyor.** 2.00:1 istenen → 1.65–1.93:1
    gerçekleşen; 4.00:1 → 3.12:1. Stop, seviyeden değil **açılıştan** doluyor (level'dan dolduran
    bir backtest bu maliyeti sıfır raporlar). Breakeven hit rate nominal %33.3'ten gerçekleşen
    %36.8'e çıkıyor — risk modelinin görmediği 3.5 puan. İlginç: stop ne kadar genişse gap erozyonu
    **oransal olarak daha büyük** (geniş stop ancak gerçekten kötü bir harekette görülür, o hareket
    de gap olma eğilimindedir).
  - **Modülün asıl işi reddetmek.** Bir barın low'u stop'a, high'ı hedefe değdiğinde günlük veri
    hangisinin önce dolduğunu **söyleyemez**; bu yazı-tura'yı çözmek bir backtest'i yalan söyletmenin
    en kolay yolu (stop desen her böyle bar zarar, hedef desen her biri kâr). `ambiguous` bucket'ına
    gidiyor, roll-up'lara **girmiyor**, ve sayısı yanında raporlanıyor — `stop_coverage`'ın bilinmeyen
    order status'e uyguladığı kuralın aynısı. Canlı ölçümde bu ±5% seviyelerinde **0** bağladı; ±1%'de
    bağlıyor (2/211) ve gap fill'ler patlıyor (78/211 = %37) — yani guard boşuna değil, sadece bu
    aralıkta ücretsiz. Ambiguous pozisyon yine de sembolü serbest bırakıyor: belirsizlik **hangi
    bacağın** dolduğunda, pozisyonun kapanıp kapanmadığında değil.
  - Diğer iki "para uydurma" kuralı: giriş barı taranmıyor (high/low'u fill'den önceki fiyatları
    içeriyor), ve giriş sinyalin close'unda değil **bir sonraki barın açılışında** doluyor.
  - `level_mix()` — bariz kolonlar totoloji olduğu için var: take-profit bacağının win rate'i tanım
    gereği %100, stop'unki %0. Bunları canlı ledger'ın gerçek win rate'inin yanına basmak yanlış
    karşılaştırmayı davet eder. Rapor bunun yerine hit rate / gerçekleşen payoff / breakeven basıyor.
  - **CAVEAT (mutlak sayılar için):** universe = bugünkü 10 isim, 2018–2025 → **survivorship bias**
    (`backtest/data.py` zaten söylüyor). Hepsi hayatta kaldı ve çoğu yükseldi, dolayısıyla mutlak
    edge iyimser. **Şekiller arası karşılaştırma** bundan çok daha sağlam ve yukarıdaki üç sonuç
    ona dayanıyor. Ayrıca giriş sinyali golden cross — LLM değil; ölçülen şey giriş değil **çıkış**.
  - 30 yeni test (**577 yeşil**), ruff 0.16.4 temiz. Commit `ad78413`.
- **DEPLOY YOK — bilinçli ve gerekli değil.** Off-decision-path, off-eval-path, canlı yolda hiçbir
  şey çalıştırmıyor; box dönünce de bir şey deploy edilmesi gerekmiyor (analiz aracı, laptop'tan
  koşuyor).

## Daily loop 2026-09-05 (🔴 BOX DARK 12. gun; app artik flatten'i strateji sanmiyor)
- **Canli durum ALINAMADI, 12. gun.** `trader.fusapp.com` -> CF **530/1033**, SSH 22 timeout, ICMP
  %100 kayip. Kurtarma hala Hetzner konsolu = Canberk. Backend deploy imkansiz. Broker'dan
  dogrudan (read-only): equity **$109,875.54**, last_equity $110,775.90 (gunluk **-$900.36 /
  -0.81%**), cash $2,829.16, buying_power $311,046.50, 10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$10,816.79**,
  net vs 100k **+$9,875.54 / +9.88%**, ACTIVE, `trading_blocked=false`. Son fill hala **08-24 META
  buy 1** -- kitap 12 gundur yonetilmiyor. Watchdog incident #1 acik (05:39Z), runlar yesil ama
  cadence hala ~2 saatte bir (schedule 30 dk) -- GitHub cron throttling, bilinen.
- [x] **Dun backend'e yazilan exit attribution'i mobile'a bagladim: "Gercekleşen" karti artik
  operator flatten'ini stratejinin cikis sicili gibi okumuyor.** (`mobile/app`: `api/types.ts`
  `ExitBucket` + opsiyonel `by_exit`/`strategy`/`unattributed`; `utils/realized.ts`
  `exitClassLabelTr`/`exitBreakdown`/`strategyReading`/`attributionNote`; `portfolio.tsx` ayri
  "Stratejinin cikislari" blogu + n rozeti + cikis yolu kirilimi.)
  - Karti bozan sey su idi: tek bir harmanlanmis expectancy, ve bu kitapta o sayi **2026-06-24
    flatten'i** (accumulation bug temizligi, operator eylemi) tarafindan domine ediliyor. Yani app
    "ajan ne kadar iyi cikiyor?" sorusuna bir temizligin P&L'i ile cevap veriyordu.
  - Strateji blogu **orneklem boyutunu yanina tasiyor** (n=8 bir hukum degil; MIN_SAMPLE=30
    altinda hicbir sey yesil/kirmizi boyanmiyor), harmanlanmis expectancy'nin alt yazisi split
    varsa "islem basi · karisik" oluyor.
  - Split alanlari client tiplerinde **opsiyonel**: deploy'daki backend attribution'dan eski, ve
    alansiz bir cevap "**henuz soyleyemiyoruz**" diye okunuyor -- asla "ajan hicbir sey
    kapatmadi" diye degil. Ayni kitap hakkinda iki farkli iddia; test bunu ayrica pinliyor
    (`strategy === undefined` -> 'unavailable', `=== null` -> 'none').
  - `unattributed > 0` oldugunda kirilimin toplamla ortusmedigi kartta yaziyor -- yarim
    siniflandirilmis bir defter tam gibi gorunmesin.
  - 26 yeni jest (**207 yesil**), backend **547 yesil**, tsc dokunulan dosyalarda temiz.
  - **OTA yayinda** (preview, update group `5ffbbd0d`, commit `6c63d01`) -- box dark oldugu icin
    kart bugun 'unavailable' kolunu gosterecek, box donunce split kendiliginden dolacak.
- **Canberk'e kalan (degismedi):** (1) Hetzner konsolu -> box'a bak, ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` +

  `cloudflared`. (2) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups Contents:read PAT).
- **Siradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) box donunce reconcile kosusu + **stop backfill**
  (265 ciplak hisse), (c) NO-GO kok nedeni hala **n=8 problemi** -- karar exit mantigini
  degistirmek degil, orneklem biriktirmek ya da backtest'te exit yolunu ayri ayri olcmek
  (decision-path'e dokunmadan once bu), (d) sizer'in cash/buying-power cap'i (branch, supervised
  run box donmeden drill edilemez).

## Daily loop 2026-09-03 (🔴 BOX DARK 10. gün; dünkü ölçüm artık ledger'ın kendi hafızasında)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 10. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → CF **1033**, SSH 22 timeout, ICMP %100
  kayıp. Kurtarma hâlâ Hetzner konsolu = Canberk. Backend deploy imkânsız, mobil değişiklik yok →
  **OTA yok**. Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only): equity **$109,513.66**, last_equity $108,472.56
  (günlük **+$1,041.10 / +0.96%**), cash $2,829.16, 10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$10,454.91**, ACTIVE,
  `trading_blocked=false`. Son fill hâlâ **08-24 META buy 1** — kitap 10 gündür yönetilmiyor.
  Watchdog relay zinciri sağlam: incident #1 gövdesi `checked-at 06:05Z`, bir öncekiyle arası 20 dk.
- [x] **Dünkü exit attribution'ı CLI'dan çıkarıp ledger'a yazdım; `/v1/trades` artık split'i
  broker'a hiç dokunmadan veriyor.** (`execution/exit_quality.py` + `storage/{models,repository}.py`
  + `scripts/reconcile.py` + `api/routes/trades.py`; read-only reporting, decision-path'e dokunmuyor.)
  Dün ölçülen tablo tek seferlik bir CLI çıktısıydı ve **app hâlâ karma expectancy gösteriyordu** —
  yani "flatten'ı strateji sanma" hatası ölçülmüş ama düzeltilmemişti. Sınıflandırma order history
  istiyor; `/v1/trades` ise tasarım gereği broker'a çağrı yapmıyor (para ekranının sayfa açılışı
  Alpaca'nın ayakta olmasına bağlanamaz, aksi halde outage "hiç işlem yok" diye render eder).
  Çözüm: sınıfı **order history'nin zaten elde olduğu yerde** — reconcile anında — karara bağlayıp
  `closed_trades.exit_class`'a yazmak; endpoint `by_exit` + `strategy` roll-up'ını oradan okuyor.
  Yeni write→read yolu, canlı broker'a karşı dünkü tabloyu **birebir** üretti (32/32 attributed,
  0 unattributed — ORDER_PAGE=500 yetiyor):

  | Çıkış yolu | n | win% | net P&L | işlem başına |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | take-profit leg | 4 | 75% | +$73.95 | +$18.49 |
  | protective stop | 3 | 33% | −$414.44 | −$138.15 |
  | agent decision sell | 1 | 100% | +$47.12 | +$47.12 |
  | flatten (agent DIŞI) | 24 | 12% | −$656.86 | −$27.37 |
  | **STRATEJİ (n=8)** | 8 | 62% | **−$293.37** | −$36.67 |
  | ~~BLENDED (app'in bugün gösterdiği)~~ | 32 | 25% | −$950.23 | −$29.69 |

  - 🔴 **Sessiz kalsa box'ı kıracak olan asıl tuzak: `create_all` eksik TABLO yaratır, eksik KOLON
    değil.** Repo'da Alembic yok. Box'taki `closed_trades` 08-09'dan beri var, dolayısıyla mapped
    bir kolon eklemek oraya migration olarak değil, ilk SELECT'te
    `OperationalError: no such column: closed_trades.exit_class` olarak varırdı — ve **boş DB'den
    başlayan her test yeşil kalırdı**. `ensure_additive_columns()` bunu kapatıyor; kasten dar
    tutuldu (additive, nullable, default yok, drop yok — fazlası gerçek migration aracı ister).
    Test "önce"ki hâli elle kurup ölçüyor, ve guard stub'lanınca gerçekten patlıyor (doğrulandı).
  - 🔴 **İkinci seam: `merge` verilen her kolonu yazar.** Sınıf order history'den geliyor, o feed
    fill feed sağlamken tek başına ölebilir → korumasız bir pass-through, **tek bir kötü koşuda
    tüm ledger'ın attribution'ını NULL'a çevirirdi** ve bu "hiç sormadık"tan ayırt edilemezdi.
    Artık sınıf vermeyen koşu, saklı olanı olduğu gibi bırakıyor (reclassification hâlâ kazanıyor).
  - **NULL ≠ `"unknown"`, baştan sona.** "Hiç attribute edilmedi" ile "baktık, broker prune etmiş"
    farklı iddialar; sadece ikincisi bucket'a girer. Attribute edilmemiş satırlar `unattributed`
    olarak sayılıyor ki **kısmi split bütünmüş gibi render edilemesin**.
  - `index_orders`/`exits_by_fill` CLI'dan saf modüle taşındı (Protocol ile, httpx runtime'a
    girmeden) — böylece `reconcile.py` CLI'ı import etmeden attribute edebiliyor, cycle yok.
  - 34 yeni test (**547 yeşil**), ruff 0.16.4 temiz, agent-ci yeşil (1m33s).
- **DEPLOY YOK — bilinçli.** Backend box'ta; box karanlık. Kod main'de, box dönünce `git pull` +
  `ai-trader-api` restart + bir `scripts/reconcile.py` koşusu sınıfları dolduracak (ilk koşuya kadar
  endpoint dürüstçe `unattributed=n`, `strategy=null` der). **Mobil slice'ı da bilerek ertelendim:**
  `by_exit`/`strategy` alanlarını okuyan bir OTA, backend inene kadar boş kart gösterirdi — karanlık
  süresi belirsizken app'e "veri yok" kartı basmak, karma expectancy'den daha iyi değil.
- **Canberk'e kalan (değişmedi):** (1) Hetzner konsolu → box'a bak, ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` +
  `journalctl -b -1 -e`, değilse power-cycle; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api`, `cloudflared`.
  (2) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups Contents:read PAT).
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) box dönünce reconcile koşusu + **stop backfill**
  (265 çıplak hisse), (c) mobil "Gerçekleşen" kartı → `strategy` + n rozeti (backend indikten SONRA),
  (d) NO-GO kök nedeni hâlâ **n=8 problemi**: exit mantığını değiştirmek değil, örneklem biriktirmek
  ya da backtest'te exit yolunu ayrı ayrı ölçmek.

## Daily loop 2026-09-02 (🔴 BOX DARK 9. gün; "realized negatif expectancy" ölçümü YANLIŞ SORUYA cevaptı)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 9. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → CF **1033**, SSH 22 timeout, ICMP %100
  kayıp. Kurtarma hâlâ Hetzner konsolu = Canberk. Backend deploy imkânsız, mobil değişiklik yok →
  **OTA yok**. Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only): equity **$108,403.84**, last_equity $108,701.66
  (günlük **−$297.82 / −0.27%**), cash $2,829.16, 10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$9,345.09**, ACTIVE,
  `trading_blocked=false`. Son fill hâlâ **08-24 META buy 1** — kitap 9 gündür yönetilmiyor.
- ✅ **Watchdog relay zinciri ÖLÇÜLDÜ — dünkü açık soru kapandı: hand-off gerçek, cadence 48/48.**
  08-31 06:29Z'den beri zincir hiç kopmadı; her link 11 probe × 30 dk atıp devrediyor ve ardıl link
  dispatch'ten **~6 saniye sonra** başlıyor (02:31→07:32→12:32→17:32→22:33→03:33). Log'lardan sayım:
  link başına 11 probe, gün başına ~4.8 link → **~52 probe/gün**, en büyük boşluk 30 dk. Karşılaştırma:

  | Dönem | Tetikleyici | Teslim/gün | En büyük boşluk |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 08-27…08-31 | GitHub cron `*/30` | 2–6 / 48 (%4–13) | **834 dk** |
  | 08-31 06:29 → 09-02 | self-dispatch zinciri | ~52 / 48 (%100+) | **30 dk** |

  Canlı teyit: incident #1 gövdesi `checked-at 2026-09-02T06:03Z`, "previous check 30 min earlier".
  Scheduled backstop'lar bu sürede 8 kez ateşledi, hepsi guard'da ~12 sn'de "zincir yaşıyor" deyip
  çıktı — yani yedek yol da beklendiği gibi ucuz. `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` HÂLÂ yok (gövdedeki
  "backup signal unavailable" bundan).
- [x] 🔴 **ASIL BULGU — realized ledger'ın %75'i stratejinin çıkışı DEĞİL, Haziran'daki accumulation
  bug'ının temizliği.** `tradingagents_us/execution/exit_quality.py` + `scripts/exit_quality.py`
  (saf modül + read-only CLI; broker'a hiçbir şey göndermiyor, DB'ye yazmıyor, **box gerektirmiyor**).
  08-14'ten beri plan'da "NO-GO kök nedeni" olarak duran satır — *32 işlem, net −$950, %25 win rate,
  profit factor 0.13, expectancy −$29.69* — tek bir sayıya sıkıştırılmış **dört farklı olay**:
  her kapanan round trip'i, kapatan broker emrine kadar geri yürüttüm (fill activity → order_id →
  order, **bracket leg'lerine inerek** — koruyucu stop hiçbir zaman top-level emir değil):

  | Çıkış yolu | n | win% | net P&L | işlem başına | ort. tutuş |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | take-profit leg | 4 | 75% | **+$73.95** | +$18.49 | 18.0g |
  | protective stop | 3 | 33% | −$414.44 | −$138.15 | 29.5g |
  | agent decision sell | 1 | 100% | **+$47.12** | +$47.12 | 4.0g |
  | **flatten (agent DIŞI)** | **24** | 12% | **−$656.86** | −$27.37 | 2.6g |
  | **strateji çıkışları (n=8)** | 8 | 62% | **−$293.37** | −$36.67 | 20.6g |

  24 işlemin tamamı **06-24 flatten'ı**: aynı ticker'ı günde 3 kez alan accumulation bug'ının
  ürettiği fazla lot'ların tek seferde market'ten boşaltılması (MSFT 103 + AAPL 99). Ortalama
  −%1.1 ve 2.6 gün tutuş — bu bir *exit disiplini kaydı değil*, bir bug'ı geri almanın slippage
  maliyeti. Sınıflandırma **provenance'tan**, P&L'den değil: `trade.py` gönderdiği her emre `tr-`
  client id damgalar, dolayısıyla broker'ın atadığı çıplak UUID'li bir market sell **kanıtlanabilir
  şekilde** agent'ın execution path'inden gelmemiştir. (Bunun söylemediği şey niyet: "agent değil"
  der, "biri flatten etmek istedi" demez — sınıf o yüzden gözlenene göre adlandırıldı.)
  - **Doğru okuma:** agent'ın kendi çıkış kaydı **n=8**, net −$293.37. Bunun **−$418.30'u tek bir
    UNH stop'u** (10+1 lot, −%9). Yani ledger exit expectancy hakkında *hiçbir* iddiayı taşıyamaz —
    örneklem 32 değil 8, ve tek gözlem toplam kaybın %140'ı. 08-14 ve 08-10 girdilerindeki
    "gerçekleşen her şey para kaybetti" cümlesi bu ayrımı yapmıyordu; düzeltilmesi gereken plan
    satırı bu.
  - **Yan bulgu (accounting, bug değil):** AMZN stop'u 234.46'da doldu ve satır **+$3.86 KÂR**
    gösteriyor — çünkü stop 236.69'da dolan lot için kurulmuştu, FIFO ise onu 230.60'lık en eski
    lot'la eşliyor. FIFO doğru konvansiyon; sonucu şu: **bir satırın P&L'i, o stop'un koruduğu
    pozisyonun P&L'i değildir.** Stop kalitesini round-trip P&L'inden okumaya çalışan her analiz
    bu yüzden yanılır.
  - **Stop coverage'ın kaynağı da netleşti:** 265/339 çıplak (%78.2) **tamamen 07-13 öncesi miras**.
    Emirlerin leg'leri gösteriyor ki eski bracket'ların koruyucu bacakları `expired`/`canceled`
    (day TIF — 07-13'te gtc'ye çevrilen tam da bu), 07-21 sonrası açılan HER pozisyon ise `held`
    (UNH 15, XOM 56, GOOGL 2, META 1 = 74 korunan). Yani backfill sınırlı ve sayılabilir bir iş:
    AAPL 33, AMZN 42, GOOGL 29, JPM 31, META 18, MSFT 27, NVDA 55, V 30.
  - 26 yeni test (**517 yeşil**), ruff temiz (0.16.4). Testlerin 4'ü kasten **dikişte**: join
    bracket leg'lerine inmezse yukarıdaki tablonun tamamı "unknown" çıkardı ve saf kurallar yine
    yeşil olurdu (08-31'in dersi).
- **Canberk'e kalan (değişmedi):** (1) Hetzner konsolu → box'a bak, ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` +
  `journalctl -b -1 -e`, değilse power-cycle; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api`, `cloudflared`.
  (2) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups Contents:read PAT).
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) box dönünce **stop backfill** (yukarıdaki 265 hisse,
  isim isim), (c) exit_quality'yi `/v1/trades`'e bağla (mobil "Gerçekleşen" kartı hâlâ karma
  expectancy gösteriyor — app şu an flatten'ı strateji sanıyor), (d) NO-GO kök nedeni artık
  **n=8 problemi**: karar, exit mantığını değiştirmek değil, örneklem biriktirmek (ya da backtest'te
  exit yolunu ayrı ayrı ölçmek) — decision-path'e dokunmadan önce bu.

## Daily loop 2026-08-31 (🔴 BOX DARK 8. gün; watchdog artık kendi saatini taşıyor)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 8. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` HTTPS bağlanmıyor, SSH 22 timeout, ICMP
  %100 kayıp. Kurtarma hâlâ Hetzner konsolu = Canberk. Backend deploy imkânsız, mobil değişiklik
  yok → **OTA yok**. Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only): equity **$109,295.94**, cash $2,829.16,
  10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$10,237.18**, ACTIVE, `trading_blocked=false`, günlük P&L −$34.84.
  Son fill hâlâ **08-24 META buy 1** — kitap 8 gündür yönetilmiyor. Stop coverage değişmedi:
  **265/339 çıplak (%78.2)**, indeterminate 0 (kapsanan tek isimler UNH 15, XOM 56, GOOGL 2, META 1).
- [x] **Watchdog'un cadence'i GitHub cron'undan alındı** (`monitoring/relay.py` +
  `scripts/watchdog_relay.py` + `.github/workflows/watchdog-relay.yml`; off-decision-path, box
  GEREKTİRMEZ, push = deploy).
  Dün ölçülen çöküş bugün de sürüyordu — istenen 48/gün'e karşı **08-29: 6, 08-30: 6, 08-31: 1**
  (06:00 UTC'ye kadar), medyan gap 58 dk, en büyük delik **834 dk**. 08-28'de cron'u `7,37`'ye
  kaydırmak ölçülebilir hiçbir şey değiştirmedi (sonraki iki gün 6/48 ve 6/48) → sorun saat başı
  tıkanıklığı değil; scheduled run'lar basitçe best-effort ve bu repo'nun ağırlığında best-effort
  istenenin sekizde biri demek. Sabah kontrolünde incident sayfası **5 saat bayattı** (son koşu
  01:35Z) — yani watchdog'un varlık sebebi olan özellik fiilen yoktu.
  **Cron'u cron'la tamir edemezsin.** Ama `workflow_dispatch` istendiğinde ateşleniyor ve
  "GITHUB_TOKEN bir workflow tetikleyemez" kuralından **muaf tutulan iki event'ten biri** —
  yani bir run, PAT'siz ve üçüncü parti pinger'sız, built-in token'la kendi ardılını başlatabilir.
  Watchdog artık uyandırılmayı beklemiyor, **uyanık kalıyor**: her link 30 dk'da bir probe atıp
  ~5s10dk sonra (6 saatlik runner tavanının altında, hand-off'a yer bırakarak) bir sonraki link'i
  dispatch ediyor. Schedule sadece **kırılmış zincirin restart yolu** olarak duruyor — nadir bir
  olay, ki güvenilmez bir tetikleyicinin yapabileceği tek iş de bu.
  - Tick'ler link'in **başlangıcına** çapalı, "son probe ne zaman bitti"ye değil: 5 saatlik bir
    pencerede uyku-tabanlı cadence iddia ettiği takvimden dakikalarca kayar, ve burası zaten tek
    işi *iddia edilen cadence'i doğru kılmak* olan kod. Slotunu aşan bir probe o okumayı kaybeder,
    sonraki her tick'i kaydırmaz.
  - `guard` job'ı **bilerek concurrency group'suz**: scheduled bir tetikleme "zincir yaşıyor mu?"
    diye sorup çıkabilmeli; group'a girseydi, şimdi cevabını istediği soruyu beklemek için 5 saat
    kuyrukta oturacaktı. Hand-off guard'ı atlar (aşağıdaki bug'a bak).
  - Zaman damgası olmayan run **alive sayılır ama asla stuck sayılmaz** — eksik bir alan sağlıklı
    bir zinciri iptal ettirmemeli. Bütçe+grace'i aşan run ise stalled: yedeği concurrency
    group'unda arkasına kuyruklanır ve GitHub timeout'u onu öldürdüğü an devralır.
  - `actions:write` watchdog.yml'e DEĞİL bu ayrı workflow'a kondu: incident dosyalayan probe dar
    kapsamını korusun, sadece işi kendini dispatch etmek olan relay dispatch edebilsin.
  - Bedeli açıkça yazıldı: bu bir runner'ı **sürekli** işgal ediyor. Kabul edilebilir olmasının tek
    sebebi repo'nun **public** olması (Actions dakikaları ölçülmüyor) ve job'ın compute değil sleep
    loop olması. Private bir repo'da bu yanlış takas olurdu, doğrusu harici bir pinger.
- 🔴 **Canlı doğrulama bir bug yakaladı, ve tam da "hiç başlamayan özellik" cinsinden.** İlk dispatch
  20 saniyede bitti: `guard`, watchdog-relay run'larını listelerken **kendi run'ını** buldu ve
  *"relay run 33364317803 is in_progress — chain is carrying the cadence"* deyip relay job'ı skip
  etti. Saf katman `exclude_ids` parametresini taşıyordu ve testi de vardı — **çağıran onu hiç
  geçirmiyordu**. Kendi `GITHUB_RUN_ID`'sini, sadece kendininkini, dışlıyor artık; parse edilemeyen
  bir id hiçbir şeyi dışlamaz (uydurulmuş bir id gerçek bir link'i dışlayabilirdi, oysa bu yönde
  hata en fazla olmayan bir zinciri var sanmaya yol açar ve backstop onu toparlar). Ders: aritmetiği
  test etmek dikişi test etmek değil — 5 test artık dikişte.
- **Canlı kanıt**: düzeltmeden sonraki dispatch'te guard `{"alive": false}` dedi, relay job koştu ve
  incident #1'in gövdesi **01:35Z → 06:30Z** tazelendi. Zincir cadence'i taşıyor.
- 30 yeni test (**491 yeşil**), ruff temiz (0.16.4).
- **Canberk'e kalan (değişmedi):** (1) Hetzner konsolu → box'a bak, ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` +
  `journalctl -b -1 -e`, değilse power-cycle; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api`, `cloudflared`.
  (2) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups Contents:read PAT).
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) zinciri bir gün izle — hand-off gerçekten oluyor mu,
  günlük teslim 48/48'e çıkıyor mu (ölçüp raporla; olmuyorsa hand-off'un neden düştüğü asıl soru),
  (c) box dönünce **stop backfill** (265/339 çıplak), (d) NO-GO kök nedeni: Underweight→SELL exit
  yolu + realized negatif expectancy (decision-path, HIGH blast, denetimli).

## Daily loop 2026-08-29 (🔴 BOX DARK 6. gün; incident kendi yaşını söylüyor + watchdog cadence'i ÇÖKMÜŞ)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 6. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → CF **1033**, SSH 22 timeout, ICMP %100
  kayıp. Kurtarma hâlâ Hetzner konsolu = Canberk. Backend deploy imkânsız, mobil değişiklik yok →
  **OTA yok**. Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only): equity **$109,330.78**, cash $2,829.16, 10 pozisyon,
  unrealized **+$10,272.03**, ACTIVE, `trading_blocked=false`. `last_equity == equity` (Cumartesi,
  piyasa kapalı). Son fill hâlâ **08-24 META buy 1** — kitap 6 gündür yönetilmiyor.
  Stop coverage değişmedi: **265/339 çıplak (%78.2)**, indeterminate 0.
- [x] **Incident artık kendi okumasının yaşını söylüyor** (`monitoring/incident_clock.py`,
  off-decision-path, box GEREKTİRMEZ, GH Actions'tan çalışır → push = deploy).
  Issue #1 08-25 07:24'te açıldı ve gövdesi **4 gün boyunca byte-byte aynı** kaldı
  (`updated_at == created_at`). Sessizlik doğruydu — state değişmedi, ve 30 dk'da bir yorum atan
  bir incident günde 48 bildirim demek. Ama "sessiz" = "hiçbir şey yazma" diye kodlanmıştı, ve
  4 gündür kıpırdamayan bir sayfayı **iki farklı dünya** üretir: (a) watchdog çalışıyor, yeni haber
  yok; (b) watchdog da 08-25 sabahı öldü ve son sözü hâlâ orada güncel görünüyor. Sayfada bunları
  ayıran hiçbir şey yoktu, o yüzden varsayılan okuma iyimser olan — yani outage kaybettiren okuma.
  - Issue **gövdesini düzenlemek kimseye bildirim göndermez**. Artık gövde **her koşuda**, sessiz
    koşularda da yeniden yazılıyor; iki instant taşıyor: outage ne zaman başladı, en son ne zaman
    doğrulandı. Alttaki satır bunun her kontrolde ilerlediğini söylüyor — donmuş bir sayfayı
    "omuz silkme"den **sinyale** çeviren şey bu: ilerlemiyorsa duran şey watchdog'un kendisi.
  - Önceki kontrolle arasındaki boşluk **varsayılmıyor, ölçülüp yazılıyor**: 67 dk'lık bir okuma
    "schedule 30 dk" yerine 67 dk olduğunu söylüyor.
  - **Yan bulgu, sessiz bug**: escalation gövdeyi `_First seen: {now}_` ile yeniden kuruyordu —
    yani kötüleşen bir outage'ın yaşı kötüleştiği ana **sıfırlanıyordu**. First-seen artık
    escalation'lar boyunca taşınıyor; marker'dan önce açılmış issue #1 için API'nin `created_at`'ine
    düşüyor (o fallback olmasa 4 günü sıfır okunacaktı — canlı doğrulandı, "open 4d 6h" yazdı).
  - Recovery yorumu artık outage'ın **ne kadar sürdüğünü** yazıyor — herkesin ilk sorduğu ve sadece
    issue kapanmadan önce ekranda olan sayı.
  - Saf zaman mantığı ayrı modülde, her instant dışarıdan veriliyor (clock okumuyor) → testler
    string'leri birebir pinliyor. Bozuk stamp `None` döndürür, **raise etmez**: elle düzenlenmiş bir
    gövde, her şey zaten kırıkken çalışmak zorunda olan tek alerter'ı susturamamalı.
  - 19 yeni test (**461 yeşil**), ruff temiz (0.16.4), agent-ci yeşil. `workflow_dispatch` ile canlı
    doğrulandı: issue #1'in `updated_at`'i **4 günde ilk kez** ilerledi, **0 yorum** atıldı.
- 🔴 **ASIL BULGU — watchdog fiilen 30 dk'da bir DEĞİL, günde ~2 kez koşuyor.** Dün "medyan 55 dk"
  ölçülmüştü; o metrik yanlış soruyu soruyor, çünkü medyan **koşan** run'ların arasına bakıyor.
  Doğru metrik günlük run sayısı (schedule 48/gün):

  | Gün | Scheduled run | Beklenen | Teslim |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 08-25 | 24 | 48 | %50 |
  | 08-26 | 18 | 48 | %38 |
  | 08-27 | **3** | 48 | %6 |
  | 08-28 | **2** | 48 | %4 |
  | 08-29 (09:21'e kadar) | 2 | ~19 | %11 |

  En büyük boşluk **834 dk = 13.9 saat** (08-28 05:05 → 18:59), tam da box karanlıkken. Çöküş
  **08-27'de başlıyor**, yani dün cron'u `7,37`'ye kaydırmak sebep değil — ama **çare de olmadı**.
  Pratik anlamı: box şu an ölse haber ~yarım gün gecikebilir, ve watchdog'un varlık sebebi tam
  olarak buydu. Bugünkü değişiklik bunu **görünür** kılıyor (gövde "son kontrol" damgasını taşıyor),
  ama **çözmüyor** — GitHub cron'unu GitHub cron'uyla tamir edemezsin.
- **Canberk'e kalan (değişmedi):** (1) Hetzner konsolu → box'a bak, ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` +
  `journalctl -b -1 -e`, değilse power-cycle; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api`, `cloudflared`.
  (2) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups Contents:read PAT).
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) **GitHub cron'una bağlı olmayan ikinci tetikleyici**
  (cron-job.org / UptimeRobot → `workflow_dispatch`, ya da doğrudan healthz izleyen harici bir
  servis) — bugünkü tabloya göre bu artık watchdog'un en zayıf halkası, (c) box dönünce
  **stop backfill** (265/339 çıplak; is_actionable 6 isim), (d) NO-GO kök nedeni:
  Underweight→SELL exit yolu + realized negatif expectancy (decision-path, HIGH blast, denetimli).

## Daily loop 2026-08-28 (🔴 BOX DARK 5. gün; stop coverage'ın doğru sayımı, watchdog'un yalancı cadence'i)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 5. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → CF **1033**, SSH 22 timeout, ICMP %100
  kayıp. `/v1/eval` ve `/v1/portfolio/snapshot` okunamıyor. Kurtarma hâlâ Hetzner konsolu = Canberk.
  Box ölü, mobil değişiklik yok → **bugün de deploy YOK** (backend deploy imkânsız, OTA gereksiz).
  Broker'dan doğrudan (read-only): equity **$108,577.67**, last_equity $108,029.01, cash $2,829.16,
  10 pozisyon, unrealized **+$9,518.92**, ACTIVE, `trading_blocked=false`. 08-24'ten beri tek emir
  yok (son fill `META buy 1` 08-24T13:34) — kitap 5 gündür yönetilmiyor, sadece piyasayla sürükleniyor.
- [x] **`risk/stop_coverage.py` — koruyucu stop kapsamının doğru sayımı** (risk muhasebesi,
  karar-yolu DIŞI, box GEREKTİRMEZ). Repo'da bu soruyu cevaplayan hiçbir kod yoktu, ve bariz yol
  parayı kaybettiren yönde yanlış.
  - **Bu hatayı bugün ben yaptım**: Alpaca'ya `status=open` sorup stop emirlerini saydım ve
    **339/339 hisse çıplak** okudum. Gerçek rakam **265/339 (%78.2)** — 08-25'ten beri değişmemiş.
    İki sebep: (a) bracket'ın bekleyen bacağı **`held`** statüsünde durur ve Alpaca'nın "open"
    filtresi `held`'i **dışarıda bırakır**, (b) bacaklar parent'ın **içine nested** döner, üst
    seviyede görünmez. İkisi de aynı yöne yanlışlar: **olmayan çıplaklık uydururlar.**
  - **Bu kötü bir rapor değil, kötü bir trade.** Bu sayının tüketicisi naked-stop backfill'i:
    korunan pozisyonu çıplak sanırsa zaten stop'u olan hisselere **ikinci bir stop** koyar, ve tek
    lot üzerinde iki stop, gap-down'da **short pozisyon** demektir. `held` stop'lar gerçekten
    çalışıyor — kanıt: 08-20'de UNH 11 hisse `held` stop **doldu**.
  - **Üç kova, iki değil**: `protected + naked + indeterminate == pozisyon`. Tanınmayan statü
    ikisine de yuvarlanmaz, `indeterminate` olur ve o ismi backfill'e **kapatır** — `cash_budget`'ın
    fiyatlanamayan emirde 0.0 yerine `None` döndürmesiyle aynı kural. Live/terminal statüler
    **allowlist**: Alpaca yarın yeni bir statü eklerse "koruma" değil "bilinmiyor" okunur.
  - Side eşleştiriliyor: long'u **SELL** stop korur, short'u **BUY**. Take-profit limit koruma
    DEĞİL — yukarıyı sınırlar, aşağı inerken hiçbir şey yapmaz; hesabın "open" görünen 5 emrinin
    **hepsi** bu (META 625, GOOGL 395×2, XOM 170, UNH 470). Ayrıca `excess_qty` (iki kez koşmuş
    bir backfill'in parmak izi) ve altında pozisyon olmayan orphan stop'lar raporlanıyor.
  - `scripts/stop_coverage.py`: salt-okunur rapor, **hiçbir emir göndermez**. Box'sız çalışır —
    kitap sahipsizken kullanılabilir olmasının bütün mesele olduğu nokta bu.
  - 22 yeni test (**442 yeşil**), ruff temiz (0.16.4). Bir test naive sayımı doğrusuyla yan yana
    pinliyor, bir diğeri `held`'in terminal sete kaymasını yakalıyor — regresyon sessizce dönemez.
  - **Canlı doğrulama:** rapor 08-25'in elle sayımıyla birebir aynı çıktı: 339 tutulan, 74 korunan
    (XOM 56/56, UNH 15/15, GOOGL 2/31, META 1/19), **265 çıplak = %78.2**; AAPL/AMZN/JPM/MSFT/NVDA/V
    tamamen çıplak. **Emir GEÇİLMEDİ** — backfill hâlâ Canberk'in kararı ve denetimli koşu şart.
- [x] **Watchdog'un cadence'i yalan söylüyordu** (ölçüldü, mitigate edildi). Cron `*/30` diyor;
  08-25..28 penceresinde 46 scheduled run'ın **medyan aralığı 55 dk**, %33'ü 1 saati aşıyor ve son
  üç aralık **10.6s / 9.7s / 8.4s**. Yani "30 dakikada bir haber alırım" garantisi yok; bir
  incident'ın verdict'i saatlerce bayat olabilir ve **bunu okuyanın anlamasının yolu yok**.
  Cron `7,37`'ye kaydırıldı — `*/30` platformdaki her cron'un istediği :00/:30'a düşüyor ve GitHub
  yerleştiremediği koşuları düşürüyor. **Bu bir teşhis değil mitigation**; çok saatlik boşlukları
  çözmez. Asıl onarım watchdog'un **kendi son kontrolünün yaşını** rapora yazması (sıradaki).
- **Canberk'e kalan (değişmedi):** (1) Hetzner konsolu → box'a bak, ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` +
  `journalctl -b -1 -e`, değilse power-cycle; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api`, `cloudflared`.
  (2) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups Contents:read PAT) — `WATCHDOG_HOST` dün kuruldu.
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk, (b) watchdog self-staleness (verdict'in yaşı incident
  gövdesinde), (c) box dönünce **stop backfill** — artık doğru input'u var: `is_actionable` olan
  6 isim, 265 hisse; indeterminate varken o isme dokunulmayacak, (d) NO-GO kök nedeni:
  Underweight→SELL exit yolu + realized negatif expectancy (decision-path, HIGH blast, denetimli).

## Daily loop 2026-08-27 (🔴 BOX DARK 4. gün; watchdog'un 3. sinyali açıldı, ruff borcu sıfırlandı)
- **Canlı durum ALINAMADI, 4. gün.** `trader.fusapp.com` → Cloudflare **1033** (tunnel yok), SSH
  22 timeout, ICMP %100 kayıp. `/v1/eval` ve `/v1/portfolio/snapshot` okunamıyor; en son bilinen
  değerler 08-22'nin **NO-GO**'su (Sharpe 0.50, +0.9% vs SPY +2.45%). Kurtarma hâlâ Hetzner
  konsolu gerektiriyor = Canberk. Box ölü olduğu için bugün **deploy edilecek bir şey yok**;
  mobil değişiklik de olmadığından OTA atlandı.
- [x] **Watchdog'un kör noktası kapatıldı** — `WATCHDOG_HOST` repo secret'ı `167.233.102.179:22`
  olarak set edildi (`gh secret set`, değer commit'lenmedi; repo ve issue'lar public). Dispatch
  ile doğrulandı: 3. sinyal artık canlı ve tasarlandığı gibi davranıyor —
  _"Direct TCP probe to the origin: no answer (timed out or filtered) … a dropped packet and an
  unplugged machine look identical from here, so it is not called."_ Yani timeout'u ölüm SAYMIYOR,
  sadece destekliyor. Asıl kazanç kurtarma yönünde: box döndüğünde accept/RST gelirse watchdog
  `wedged` (host ayakta, tunnel ölü → önce ssh) ile gerçek `dark` arasını **ayırt edebilecek**;
  4 gündür verebildiği tek cevap `edge_down` = "bilemiyorum" idi. Issue #1 doğru şekilde sessiz
  kaldı (state değişmedi → yorum spam'i yok). `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` hâlâ boş ama artık şart değil.
- [x] **Ruff borcu 337 → 0; agent-ci'da gerçek gate oldu.** Dünkü bulgunun ikinci yarısı: suite'i
  öne alıp ruff'ı `continue-on-error` yapmak testleri açmıştı, ama "kimsenin geçmek zorunda
  olmadığı linter" de okunmaz hale gelir — workflow'un kendi notu "sayı sıfırlanınca flag'i kaldır"
  diyordu. Bugün sıfırlandı:
  - **164 autofix** (UP017 `timezone.utc`→`UTC`, unused import, quoted annotation, import sort).
  - **64 E501** elle sarıldı (imza/çağrı/f-string; semantik değişiklik yok).
  - **~21 gerçek küçük bulgu**: `SP500HistoryUnavailable`→`…Error` (N818, 4 dosya), `raise
    SystemExit(1) from exc`, 4× `contextlib.suppress`, iç içe `if` birleştirme, `line`
    loop-shadow'ları (6×) `raw`'a, `%`-format → f-string, `type(x)==bool` → `np.dtype`,
    `api.main`'de builtin gölgeleyen `eval` → `eval as eval_routes`.
  - **`zip(ts, eq, strict=True)`** (eval_report equity curve): uzunluk uyuşmazlığı bozuk bir Alpaca
    payload'u demek; sessizce kırpılmış bir eğri **kendinden emin ve yanlış** bir Sharpe üretir.
    Raporu çökertmek, o rakamı yayınlamaktan iyi.
  - **Kurallar kod yerine config'te reddedildi, gerekçesiyle**: `PLC0415` (123) — hepsi kasıtlı;
    `jose` fail-closed, `boto3` sadece S3 yolunda, watchdog bilerek stdlib-only. `B008` (21+4) —
    FastAPI `Depends`/`Query` ve `frozen=True` config dataclass'ları → `extend-immutable-calls`.
    `PLR0917` — `PLR0913` zaten muaf, birini tutup diğerini zorlamak tutarsız.
  - **6 complexity bulgusu susturulmadı, kapsamlandı**: `trade.py:main`, `backup.py:main`,
    `executor.py:submit_order` için `per-file-ignores`. Kural yeni kodda ötmeye devam ediyor;
    `submit_order` canlı execution path'i — linter'ı memnun etmek için yapılan restructuring tam
    da bu projenin paper drill olmadan yapmadığı değişiklik.
  - Ruff `>=0.8.0` → **`>=0.16.4,<0.17`** pinlendi: gate olduğu andan itibaren sınırsız bir linter,
    kimsenin koda dokunmadığı bir sabah main'i kırmak için başkasının release'ini bekliyor demektir.
  - 420 test yeşil, `ruff check .` temiz (0.16.4). Off-decision-path — hiçbir karar/emir mantığı
    değişmedi.
- **Sıradaki:** (a) box kurtarma = Canberk (Hetzner konsolu), (b) döndüğünde ilk iş **78% naked
  stop backfill** (265/339 hisse korumasız) + realized ledger'ın negatif expectancy'si,
  (c) NO-GO kök nedeni: Underweight→SELL exit yolu + over-cap trim politikası (decision-path,
  HIGH blast, denetimli paper run şart — Canberk'in kararı).

## Daily loop 2026-08-26 (🔴 BOX HÂLÂ DARK — 2. gün; watchdog 30 dk'da bir "bilemiyorum" diyordu)
- **Canlı durum:** box 08-24 ~13:34 UTC'den beri ölü, **~40 saat**. SSH timeout, ICMP yok, CF
  530/1033. `trader.fusapp.com` down → `/v1/eval` ve `/v1/portfolio/snapshot` ALINAMIYOR (dünkü
  rakamlar son bilinen değer). Ağım sağlam: aynı anda başka bir Scaleway box'a SSH açılıyor.
  Provider konsolu bende yok (hcloud/scw CLI ve credential yok) → **reboot Canberk'in aksiyonu**.
- **Asıl bulgu — watchdog çalıştı ama 40 saattir bir şey SÖYLEYEMEDİ.** Incident #1 08-25 07:24'te
  açıldı ve o gün bugündür `edge_down` = *"tünel mi öldü host mu, ayırt edemiyorum"* durumunda
  takılı. Sebep: ikinci sinyal (private backup repo) `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` secret'ı kurulmadığı
  için **404** okuyor. Yani iki sinyalden biri kalıcı olarak kör, ve tek kör sinyal bütün verdict'i
  köreltti — host gerçekten dark'ken alarm "emin değilim" demeyi sürdürdü.
- [x] **Üçüncü sinyal: origin'e direkt TCP probe** (monitoring, karar-yolu DIŞI, box'a deploy
  GEREKTİRMEZ — GitHub runner'da koşuyor; box zaten ölü olduğu için ship edilebilen tek iş sınıfı).
  - **Hiçbir credential istemiyor.** Diğer iki sinyal revoke/rate-limit/404 edilebilir; bir socket
    edilemez. Ve diğer ikisinin yapamadığı şeyi yapabiliyor: **makinenin ayakta olduğunu
    kanıtlamak** (sustuktan sonra health probe da backup da bunu kanıtlayamaz).
  - **Asimetri bilinçli:** connect kabul edildi **veya RST ile reddedildi** → kernel konuştu, host
    ayakta (soru host hakkında, portta ne dinlediği hakkında değil). Timeout → **kanıt değil**;
    drop eden bir firewall ile fişi çekilmiş makine dışarıdan birebir aynı görünür. Bu yüzden
    sessizlik sadece diğer sinyallerin zaten kurduğu davayı **destekler**, tek başına asla `dark`
    ilan etmez. Outage uyduran alarm, kaçıran alarmdan beterdir.
  - **Yeni state `wedged`** (`dark` ile `edge_down` arası): kernel cevap veriyor ama tünel de backup
    da ölü = dolu disk / OOM / yarım boot. Kitap `dark`'taki kadar sahipsiz, ama ilk hamle farklı —
    ssh muhtemelen çalışır. Bir shell'in çözeceği şey için kimseyi datacenter konsoluna yollamak,
    remedy'nin okunmamaya başladığı andır. Severity'ler 10'ar aralıklı: araya state girerse
    yeniden numaralama gerekmiyor, bilinmeyen state hâlâ en kötü sıralanıyor (99).
  - **Adres literal değil SECRET** (`WATCHDOG_HOST`, `host[:port]`, virgüllü liste). Bu repo ve
    açtığı issue'lar **public**; Cloudflare'in arkasındaki origin IP tam da proxy'nin sakladığı şey.
    Adres probe objesinde hiç taşınmıyor → incident metninin yanlışlıkla interpolate edeceği bir
    şey yok. Exception string'i de asla basılmıyor (`gaierror` hostname taşır), sadece sabit
    kategoriler ("connection accepted/refused", "timed out or filtered"). İki test bunu pinliyor.
  - **Secret yoksa davranış bit-bit eskisi** (test: aynı state **ve** aynı body). Yani bu commit
    tek başına hiçbir alarm sesini değiştirmiyor; sadece secret kurulunca kör nokta kapanıyor.
  - 22 yeni test (**420 backend yeşil**), ruff temiz. Canlı dry-run gerçek outage'a karşı doğrulandı:
    verdict artık *"iki bağımsız yol da sessiz → dead host'a meylediyor, önce konsola bak"* diyor.
- [x] **CI hiç çalışmamış — aynı hastalık, ikinci vaka** (infra, off-eval-path). Watchdog'u push
  ederken fark ettim: `agent-ci` **bu repo'nun tarihinde hiç yeşil olmamış**, her push'ta Ruff'ta
  patlamış. Ruff ilk adım olduğu için **Pytest ve image build BİR KEZ BİLE ÇALIŞMAMIŞ** — yani 420
  test main'i hiç gate'lememiş, sadece benim local'imde koşmuş. Hiç yeşil olmamış bir gate gate
  değildir; insanların scroll'layıp geçmeyi öğrendiği kırmızı bir karedir (watchdog'la birebir
  aynı failure mode: alarm var, sinyal yok).
  - Sıra değişti: **önce suite**, sonra linter'lar. Ruff, mypy'ın yanına *advisory* olarak geçti —
    aynı gerekçe, aynı geçicilik: kendi kodumuzda bu workflow'dan ESKİ ~337 finding var, testleri
    açan commit'te onları temizlemek testleri kimsenin okuyamayacağı bir diff'in altına gömerdi.
    **Borç burada kayıtlı; sayı sıfırlanınca `continue-on-error` kalkacak** — kimsenin uymak
    zorunda olmadığı linter de okunmamaya başlar.
  - `vendor/` susturulmadı, **hariç tutuldu**: 898 finding'in 561'i oradaydı, upstream
    TradingAgents'ın stilini biz belirlemiyoruz ve yeniden formatlamak her rebase'i conflict yapardı.
  - İlk kez koşan build job da anında patladı: Dockerfile `tradingagents_tr/` kopyalıyordu —
    `_tr`→`_us` rename'inden beri **image build edilemez durumdaydı**, ama kontrol hiç
    çalışmadığı için görünmemişti. Tek satır düzeltildi. **Prod etkilenmedi**: box git'ten
    çalışıyor, bu image hiçbir yere deploy edilmiyor — bozuk olan üretim değil, kontroldü.
  - Sonuç: agent-ci **repo tarihinde ilk kez yeşil** (a3b95d6) — 420 test + image build CI'da doğrulandı.
- **Canberk'e kalan (ikisi de secret/konsol işi, ben yapamam):**
  1. Hetzner/Scaleway konsolundan box'a bak → ayaktaysa `ssh agentmesh` + `journalctl -b -1 -e`,
     değilse power-cycle; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api.service`, `cloudflared` doğrula.
  2. Repo secret'larından **biri** watchdog'un kör noktasını kapatır: `WATCHDOG_HOST`
     (`167.233.102.179:22`, en kolayı) veya `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` (trading-backups'a Contents:read
     fine-grained PAT).
- Live: **ALINAMADI** (box down). Eval durumu 08-22 itibarıyla **NO-GO** olarak duruyor.
- Sıradaki: box ayağa kalkınca (a) ölüm sebebi post-mortem (`journalctl -b -1`), (b) 08-22'den kalan
  realized negatif expectancy / exit mantığı, (c) reflection-memory wiring (branch).

## Daily loop 2026-08-25 (🔴 BOX DARK — trader çalışmıyor, hiçbir alarm ötmedi)
- **Olay:** Hetzner box (167.233.102.179) yanıt vermiyor — SSH timeout, ICMP yok, Cloudflare
  tüneli 530/1033. Traceroute Hetzner FSN1 core'una kadar gidiyor, son hop'ta ölüyor → ağ
  Hetzner'a ulaşıyor, **host cevap vermiyor**. `trader.fusapp.com` down, `/v1/eval` ve
  `/v1/portfolio/snapshot` alınamıyor. rover/n8n de aynı box'ta, onlar da down.
- **Ölüm penceresi (kanıt):** son emir 2026-08-24T08:00 UTC'de gönderildi ve 13:34'te doldu
  (`tr-META-20260821-BUY`), yani dün sabahki daily run **çalıştı**. Ama off-box backup repo'sunun
  (`canberkaslan/trading-backups`) en yeni commit'i **2026-08-24T02:16 UTC** — bugünkü 02:15 UTC
  backup timer'ı HİÇ ÇALIŞMADI. Yani box 08-24 ~13:34 UTC ile 08-25 02:15 UTC arasında öldü.
- **Asıl bulgu — hiçbir alarm ötmedi ve ötemezdi.** Sahip olduğumuz her alerting yolu o box'ta
  çalışan bir process: daily run'ın exit code'u, systemd `OnFailure=`, `scripts/inert_alert`,
  healthchecks.io dead-man ping'i (zaten hiç konfigüre edilmemişti, item 10 KALAN). Watchdog'un
  izlediği makinede yaşaması demek, izleyebildiği sürece "sağlıklı" deyip sonra hiçbir şey
  dememesi demek. Outage sabah elle bulundu.
- [x] **Off-box watchdog** (monitoring, karar-yolu DIŞI, box'a deploy GEREKTİRMEZ — bu yüzden
  bugün ship edilebilen tek iş). `.github/workflows/watchdog.yml` her 30 dk GitHub runner'da
  koşuyor; GitHub'ın scheduler'ı o host'a hiçbir şekilde bağlı değil, tek önemli özellik bu.
  - **İki bağımsız sinyal**, çünkü "erişilemiyor"un birden çok sebebi var: (a) public health
    endpoint — Cloudflare edge → tünel → cloudflared → uvicorn yolunu kat eder; (b) backup
    repo'sunun en yeni commit'i — 02:15 UTC timer'ı düz outbound HTTPS ile push'lar, tünel
    yoluyla **host dışında hiçbir şey paylaşmaz**. İkisi birlikte, tarayıcıdan aynı görünen iki
    outage'ı ayırıyor: tünel ölü + backup'lar geliyorsa host ayakta (`systemctl restart
    cloudflared` yeter), ikisi de sessizse **host gitmiş** (sadece konsol/power-cycle çözer).
    Birini diğerinden ayırmak değerin çoğu — "site down" diye 3'te uyanıp ölü tünel bulmak
    insanların pager'ı susturmayı öğrenme şekli.
  - **Cloudflare'in kendi hata sayfaları origin'in cevabı DEĞİL.** 530/1033/502 edge'in "tünele
    ulaşamadım" demesi → "ulaşılamadı" sayılıyor, "API cevap verdi ama mutsuz" değil. 500'ün
    altındaki her şey (404 dahil) origin'in kendi kurduğu bir cevap = uvicorn ayakta.
  - **GitHub okunamazsa `age_hours=None`, asla "çok eski" değil.** Bir GitHub kesintisinin host'u
    ölü ilan edebilmesi, outage uyduran bir alarm sistemi demek — kaçıran bir sistemden beter,
    çünkü bir sonraki gerçek olan görmezden gelinir. Tek sinyalle `dark` denmez.
  - 24h + 2h grace: timer jitter'ı yüzünden (02:41'de koştu diye) page eden watchdog kapatılan
    watchdog'dur.
  - **Sessizlik dedup'ı:** 30 dk'da bir koşuyor → aynı outage için tek issue, yorum SADECE
    kötüye giderken (severity artışı). Her koşuda yorum atsa günde 48 bildirim eder ve ikinci
    gün kimse okumaz. Recovery bir kez yorum + issue kapanış. Tanınmayan state en kötü sıralanır.
  - **Repo public** → issue gövdesi sadece liveness gerçeği taşır, asla equity/pozisyon/hesap.
    Bir test bunu construction olarak sabitliyor (birisi sonra "alarmı zenginleştirmek" için
    broker verisi geçirirse ilk o patlar).
  - Stdlib-only, bağımlılık yok, `uv sync` yok: bozuk bir lockfile ya da registry kesintisi son
    çalışan alerting yolunu da götürebilmemeli. `GITHUB_TOKEN` dışında secret istemiyor.
    Box dark olsa bile exit 0 — issue sinyaldir; kırmızı run üstüne aynı haberin ikinci bildirimi
    olur ve bozuk watchdog'la ayırt edilemez.
  - 34 yeni test (`test_liveness.py` 16 + `test_watchdog.py` 18), **398 backend yeşil**.
  - Canlı dry-run bugünkü gerçek outage'ı doğru teşhis etti: `state=dark`, health `HTTP 530
    (tunnel not reached)`, backup `28.0h ago`.
- **⚠️ KALAN (tek kullanıcı adımı, 2 dk):** ilk gerçek workflow koşusu backup sinyalini
  okuyamadı — `trading-backups` **private** ve workflow'un built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`'ı sadece bu
  repo'ya scope'lu, GitHub da private repo'yu 404 diye saklıyor. Watchdog bunu doğru ele aldı
  (tek sinyalle `dark` demedi, `edge_down` dedi) ama o hâliyle tek gözlü: "erişilemiyor" der,
  ölü tünelle ölü host'u ayıramaz. 404/403'ü artık "no read access — set WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN"
  diye yazıyor (GitHub kesintisi sanılıp status.github.com'a gidilmesin diye).
  **Yapılacak:** `canberkaslan/trading-backups` üstünde Contents:read olan fine-grained bir PAT
  üret, `trading` repo'suna `WATCHDOG_BACKUP_TOKEN` secret'i olarak koy. Secret'i ben koymadım —
  credential üretmek/yerleştirmek Canberk'in işi.
- **NOT: `agent-ci` kırmızı ama benim yüzümden değil** — `vendor/tradingagents/` ağacında
  900 pre-existing ruff bulgusu var, aynı hata 08-22 commit'inde de vardı. Yeni dosyalar temiz
  (eklediğim 2 UP017 bulgusu `datetime.UTC`'ye çevrilerek kapatıldı).
- **🔴 Kitabın %78'inde canlı stop yok (broker'dan doğrudan sayıldı).** Box ölü olduğu için
  Alpaca'ya lokalden read-only sorduk. 339 hissenin **265'i korumasız**: sadece UNH (15/15) ve
  XOM (56/56) tam kapalı, GOOGL 2/31, META 1/19; AAPL/AMZN/JPM/MSFT/NVDA/V **tamamen çıplak**.
  Sebep: item 3'ün GTC protective leg fix'i (2026-07-13) sadece YENİ emirlere uygulanıyor;
  Haziran/Temmuz'da alınan büyük lotların `day` leg'leri kapanışta expire etti ve kimse mevcut
  kitabı backfill etmedi. Sonraki alımlar 1-2 lot olduğu için kapsama kıpırdamıyor.
  **Emir GEÇİLMEDİ** — kill-switch'i ve agent'ın kendi mantığını bypass ederek laptop'tan
  execution path'e emir yazmak tam da bu planın tekrar tekrar reddettiği şey, üstelik koordine
  edecek box da ölü. Canberk'in çağrısı.
- Live: **alınamadı** (API down). Broker'dan doğrudan: equity **$107,916.69**, last_equity
  $107,022, cash $2,829.17, 10 pozisyon, toplam unrealized **+$8,857.93**. Hesap ACTIVE,
  `trading_blocked=false`. Bugünkü 08:00 UTC run'ı box ölü olduğu için **kaçacak**.
- Sıradaki: (a) box'u ayağa kaldır (Hetzner konsolu; sonra `ai-trader.timer`, `ai-trader-api`,
  `cloudflared` doğrula) — watchdog artık bunu kendisi söyleyecek. (b) **Stop backfill politikası**:
  mevcut kitaba koruyucu GTC stop takan, agent'ın içinde yaşayan bir reconcile adımı
  (`scripts/reconcile.py` zaten var) — HIGH blast, supervised. (c) `HEALTHCHECK_URL` hâlâ boş;
  watchdog onun yerini büyük ölçüde tutuyor ama dead-man ping ucuz. (d) 08-22'den devreden:
  underweight→SELL exit path.

## Daily loop 2026-08-22 (eval CLOSED — **NO-GO** 23/10d; kitap çözüldü, sebebi tesadüf)
- [x] **Cap reddi artık hangi kısıtın bağladığını söylüyor** (risk katmanı, karar-yolu DEĞİL —
  deployed 6640d1a + OTA). 30 günde 227 reddin **91'i** order log'una çıplak
  `trimmed_to_zero_by_portfolio_caps` olarak düşüyordu; bu string iki bambaşka durumu aynı
  yazıyor: (a) isim zaten %10 cap'inde — o isme bir daha ASLA BUY geçmez, ta ki pozisyon
  kırpılana ya da equity büyüyene kadar (yapısal donma), (b) gerçek headroom var ama bir
  hisseyi almaya yetmiyor (granülerlik; bir sonraki yukarı harekette kendi kendine çözülür).
  `position_cap_headroom()` `apply_portfolio_caps`'in attığı gerekçeyi döndürüyor (headroom,
  mevcut ağırlık, `at_cap`, `priceable`); `apply_portfolio_caps` artık onun üstünde bir `min()` —
  **aritmetik aynı, hiçbir karar değişmedi**.
  - **Bucket anahtarı bilerek harfi harfine aynı bırakıldı.** Detay, actionability raporunun
    zaten soyduğu trailing parantezde gidiyor. Anahtarı yeniden adlandırmak inert alert'e
    "dominant blocker değişti" diye okunur ve **hiç kıpırdamamış** bir freeze için tekrar page
    ederdi.
  - `priceable=False` (fiyat ≤ 0) üçüncü bir dal: hisse sayısı hakkında hiçbir şey söylemez,
    "cap'te" demek olmaz. `at_cap` ile `max_new_shares == 0` ayrı kavramlar — ikincisi
    sub-share durumunda da doğru.
  - Detayda **iç içe parantez yok** (test'le sabitlendi): normalize_reason tek bir trailing
    `(...)` soyuyor, iç içe bir çift artık parça bırakıp tek sebebi birden çok bucket'a dağıtırdı —
    yani bu detayın önlemek için var olduğu şeyi yapardı.
  - Mobil: `rejectionReasonTr` backend'in zaten parantezlediği detayı **çift sarıyordu** —
    `Harcanabilir nakit kalmadı ((spendable=$0.00))`; cash cap 08-14'ten beri bu şekilde
    yayınlanıyor, yani bug canlıydı. Sadece tüm detayı çevreleyen tek dış çift soyuluyor
    (`foo (a) bar (b)` dokunulmadan geçiyor — ilk/son parantezi atmak iki ayrı ara cümleyi
    birbirine yapıştırırdı). 16 backend testi (**364 yeşil**), 7 mobil (**192 yeşil**), tsc
    2 bilinen pre-existing hariç temiz.
- **Canlı doğrulama (box, deploy sonrası, gerçek kitap rakamlarıyla):** MSFT **%12.2** (cap'in
  ÜSTÜNDE), V %10.4, JPM %10.2, AMZN %10.1 → hepsi `at ... of equity, headroom=$0.00`;
  GOOGL `headroom=$12.78 ... below 1 share @ $344.82`; META headroom $804 → **1 hisse geçiyor**.
  Yani dün gece kitabı çözen tek emir (META BUY 1 lot, 23:55, broker accepted) bir strateji
  sinyali değil, **cap headroom'unun tek bir hisse fiyatını aşan tek isim olması**. Kitap 10 gün
  donduktan sonra tesadüfen kıpırdadı.
- **Yapısal tespit (Canberk'in kararı, kod DEĞİŞMEDİ):** 10 isimlik kitap + %10 tek-isim cap =
  toplam %100 → tanım gereği doygun. Cap sadece EKLEMEYİ durduruyor, kırpmayı zorlamıyor; bu
  yüzden MSFT %12.2'ye çıkabildi ve orada kalıyor. Underweight→SELL exit path olmadığı sürece
  kitap sadece TUTABİLİR: 227 reddin 132'si Hold, 91'i cap. GO/NO-GO'nun ölçtüğü şey bu.
- Live: verdict **NO-GO** (ilk kez) — Sharpe **0.50** (gate 1.0 ❌), MaxDD −2.86% ✅, getiri
  **+0.9% vs SPY +2.45%** → α **−1.55pp** ❌, Sortino 0.79, Calmar 3.79, 23/10 gün, eval_complete.
  Equity **$107,022**, cash $3,378, günlük +$196 (+0.18%), 10 pozisyon.
  Order flow: 30 günde 233 emir / **6 submitted (%2.6)**, `inert_run_days` **1** (verdict `active`),
  son broker ack 2026-08-21T23:55.
- **Push kanalı hâlâ abonesiz** (`device_tokens` = 0 satır) → freeze de recovery de kimseye
  gitmedi. inert_alert bunu doğru ele alıyor (teslim edilmeden state yazmıyor) ama alarmlar
  Canberk app'te bildirim izni verene kadar teorik.
- Sıradaki: (a) **Underweight→SELL exit path** — kök neden, HIGH blast, supervised paper run şart,
  Canberk'in çağrısı. (b) Cap semantiği: %10 tek-isim cap'i AŞAN isim (MSFT %12.2) için rebalance/
  trim politikası var mı? (c) SPY gate'i hard yapma kararı — /v1/eval zaten NO-GO diyor ama
  Sharpe yüzünden; ikisi de kırmızı.

## Daily loop 2026-08-21 (eval CLOSED — GO 23/10d, kitap 9 run günüdür DONMUŞ)
- [x] **Inert order-flow push alert** (backend, off-decision-path — deployed 28a9e28).
  Dünkü iş teşhisi app'e taşıdı; ama teşhisin bütün mesele olduğu durumda (donmuş kitap her
  metrikte sağlıklı görünür) kimsenin app'i açmak için bir sebebi yok. Kanıt: kitap **08-11'den
  beri** inert, GO rozeti 9 run günüdür render ediliyor ve hiçbir şey kimseyi uyandırmadı.
  `scripts/inert_alert.py` artık `daily_run.sh`'ın kuyruğunda: aynı order row'ları, aynı eşik
  (`INERT_THRESHOLD_RUN_DAYS` route'tan actionability modülüne taşındı — rozet ile push'un
  "donmuş" tanımı hakkında ayrışması mümkün olmasın), run günü başına **en fazla bir** push.
  Politika saf ve test edilebilir (`notifications/inert_alert.py`), asıl kararlar SUSMA
  kararları:
  - **`idle` asla uyarmaz.** Boş pencere = run hiç olmadı; bu cron'un arızası ve zaten
    daily_run'ın exit code'u + healthchecks dead-man's switch'i sahipleniyor. Burada
    raporlamak stratejiyi scheduler'ın suçuyla itham etmek olurdu — ve yanlış subsystem için
    bağıran bir alert, insanların swipe etmeyi öğrendiği alerttir.
  - Bilinen bir freeze yalnızca **5 run günü daha derinleşince** ya da **dominant blocker
    değişince** tekrar uyarır (aynı derinlikte yeni bir sebep yeni bilgidir). Pencere kayarken
    `inert_run_days` düşebiliyor — bu bir çözülme değil, o yüzden re-alert tetiklemiyor.
  - **Recovery bir kez** push'lanır, sadece freeze'i gerçekten raporladıysak: donduğu söylenen
    birinin çözüldüğünü öğrenmesinin başka yolu yok.
  - State **sadece teslim edilen push'tan sonra** yazılır (`_send` → `(delivered, detail)`;
    cihaz yok / `PUSH_DISABLED` / Expo hatası hepsi False döner). Teslim edilmemiş bir alert'i
    "raporlandı" diye kaydetmek bu script'i sessizliğe çeviren tek bug. Bozuk state dosyası ise
    "hiç uyarılmadı" okunur — fazladan bir push, donmuş kitap hakkında sessizlikten iyidir.
  Her koşulda exit 0 (daily run'ın kendi exit code'unu maskelemesin) ve kill-switch skip
  yollarının ALTINDA duruyor — PAUSE_NEW/FLATTEN_ALL kitabı kasıtlı olarak inert'tir, page etmez.
  21 yeni test (**348 backend** yeşil). Box'a deploy + API restart, /healthz 200. Canlı dry-run:
  `verdict=inert inert_run_days=9 submitted=6/234 → ⚠️ ... top blocker: rating=Hold (131)`.
- **YENİ BULGU — push kanalının abonesi YOK:** `device_tokens` tablosunda **0 satır**. Yani bu
  alert de, **kill_check'in FLATTEN_ALL PARTIAL alarmı da, daily run failure alarmı da** bugüne
  kadar hiçbir yere gitmedi (`notify_ops` "no registered devices" deyip 0 dönüyor — best-effort
  tasarımı gereği sessiz). Kanal ancak Canberk app'i açıp bildirim izni verince (mobile →
  `POST /v1/notifications/register`) canlanır. Yeni alert bunu doğru ele alıyor: teslim
  edilmedi → state yazılmadı → cihaz kaydolduğu ilk gün 9 günlük freeze'i anlatarak ateşler.
- Live: verdict GO — Sharpe 1.23, Sortino 1.98, MaxDD −2.69%, Calmar 8.58, 23/10 gün.
  Getiri **+1.83% vs SPY +1.91% → α −0.08pp** (SPY gate ❌). Equity $106,990, günlük −$703 (−0.65%),
  cash $3,378 (negatif değil — 08-14 cash cap tutuyor), 10 pozisyon.
  Order flow: 30 günde **234 emir, 6 submitted (%2.56)**, `inert_run_days` **9**, son ack 08-11.
- Sıradaki: (a) **Underweight→SELL exit path** — hâlâ kök neden, hâlâ Canberk'in çağrısı
  (decision-path, HIGH blast, supervised paper run şart). (b) SPY hard-gate kararı.
  (c) push kanalını canlandır (app'te bildirim izni) — aksi halde tüm ops alarmları teorik.

## Daily loop 2026-08-20 (eval CLOSED — GO 22/10d, kitap 8 run günüdür DONMUŞ)
- [x] **Actionability mobile'a bağlandı** (OTA + commit 596bd2c, read-only, off-decision-path).
  Dün eklenen `/v1/diagnostics/actionability` sadece curl'de yaşıyordu; verdict'in fiilen OKUNDUĞU
  iki yere taşındı. Mesele şu: karnedeki HER gate equity curve'den hesaplanıyor ve kendi sizing
  cap'lerini artık geçemeyen, tam yatırımlı bir sepetin de equity curve'ü var — "çalışıyor" ile
  "donmuş" app'te birebir aynı görünüyordu (8 run günüdür GO rozeti, son broker ack'i 08-11).
  - Portfolio → **"Emir akışı" kartı**: durum, üretilen emirlerin broker'a ulaşan payı
    (bugün **6/234 = %2.56**), son ack'in yaşı, red nedenleri bar olarak.
  - Portfolio hero rozeti + Settings karnesi: GO rozetinin yanına `⚠︎ donmuş kitap · 8g`,
    karneye tek satır caveat — **sadece** akış inert'ken. Her zaman uyaran rozet, uyarıyı öğretmez.
  Dürüstlük kuralları saf helper'larda (`utils/actionability.ts`), yani test edilebilir:
  0 emir "hiç denenmedi"dir, "%0 gönderildi" DEĞİL (ikisi stratejiye dair zıt şeyler söyler);
  boş pencere **idle** (eksik cron), asla inert; bilinmeyen verdict verbatim render ediliyor;
  bar'lar `refused`'a değil **en sık nedene** göre ölçekleniyor (bir emir aynı anda birden çok
  nedenle reddedilebildiği için toplam refused'ı aşar, refused-paydalı bar %100'ü geçerdi);
  atalet **run günü** sayıyor, pazartesi hafta sonunu 2 günlük sessizlik diye raporlamasın diye.
  Yan iş: `relativeAgeTr`/`parseUtc` → `utils/format` (realized kartıyla tek yaş merdiveni + tek
  naive-timestamp kuralı; cihaz-local parse her yaşı UTC offset'i kadar kaydırır — İstanbul'da 3sa,
  bir stale bayrağını ters çevirmeye yeter) ve `trimmed_to_zero_by_cash_cap` TR etiketi eklendi
  (08-14'ten beri ham İngilizce render ediliyordu). 22 yeni jest (**189**), **327 backend** yeşil,
  tsc temiz (2 bilinen pre-existing hariç).
- **CANLI TEŞHİS kötüleşti:** 30 günde **234 emir, 6'sı broker'a ulaştı (%2.56)**, 228 red.
  Son gönderim **08-11** → `inert_run_days` 6 → **8**. Nedenler: `non-actionable rating=Hold` 130 ·
  `trimmed_to_zero_by_portfolio_caps` 93 · `rating=Underweight` 2 · `cash_cap` 1.
  Cash **−$856.29** (7. gün, hiç geri ödenmiyor), 10 pozisyon, hepsi %10 cap'te ya da üstünde.
- Live: verdict GO — Sharpe 1.14, Sortino 1.83, MaxDD −2.69%, Calmar 8.15, 22/10 gün.
  Getiri **+1.67% vs SPY +2.78% → α −1.11pp** (SPY gate ❌). Equity $107,864, günlük +$345 (+0.32%).
  **Sharpe 1.14, gate'in (1.0) hemen üstünde** — 1M penceresi kaydıkça eriyor (08-16: 1.92 → bugün 1.14).
- Sıradaki: (a) **Underweight→SELL exit path** (sizer.py:45 `_side_from_rating` None dönüyor,
  hiçbir caller karar vermiyor → tek çıkış yolu `Sell`; trim yok → cap altına inilmiyor → yeni BUY
  sonsuza kadar bloke). Decision-path + HIGH blast, boyutlandırma politikası Canberk'in çağrısı —
  supervised paper run şart. (b) inert>=3 run günü için günlük push (backend, off-decision-path).
  (c) SPY hard-gate kararı.

## Daily loop 2026-08-18 (eval CLOSED — GO 21/10d, ama kitap DONMUŞ)
- [x] **`/v1/diagnostics/actionability`** (read-only, DB-only, off-decision-path — deployed 44d1df5).
  /v1/eval equity curve'ü ölçüyor; tamamen yatırımlı, kendi sizing cap'lerini artık geçemeyen bir
  sepetin de equity curve'ü var. Yani "strateji çalışıyor" ile "strateji donmuş" bugüne kadarki
  HER metrikte aynı görünüyordu. Yeni endpoint eksik soruyu emir satırlarından cevaplıyor:
  kaç emir broker'a ulaştı, geri kalanını ne engelledi, kaç ardışık **run günü** sıfır gönderimle
  kapandı. İki kasıtlı kural: `submitted` = broker ack'i, `risk_approved` DEĞİL (risk_approved
  ajanın kendine verdiği not; niyeti icra saymak tam da bu endpoint'in yakalamak için var olduğu
  iyimserlik). `inert_run_days` **run günü** sayıyor, takvim günü değil — hafta sonu satır
  üretmediği için takvimle sayarsak her pazartesi 2 gün atalet raporlanır; boş pencere ise
  "idle", asla "inert" (run hiç olmamış olabilir, bu stratejinin suçu değil). Reason'lardaki
  canlı değer parantezi normalize ediliyor (`(spendable=$0.00)` / `(spendable=$18.40)` → tek
  bucket), yoksa kalıcı bir blocker tek tek anomalilere dağılıp görünmez oluyor.
  23 yeni test (327 backend yeşil).
- **CANLI TEŞHİS (asıl mesele):** 30 günde **224 emir, sadece 7'si broker'a ulaştı** (%3.1),
  217 reddedildi. Son gönderim **08-11** → `inert_run_days=6`, verdict **inert**.
  Reddedilme nedenleri (30g): `non-actionable rating=Hold` 121 · **`trimmed_to_zero_by_portfolio_caps` 91**
  · `non-actionable rating=Underweight` 2 · `trimmed_to_zero_by_cash_cap` 1.
  Yani kitap 10 isimde, her biri %10 per-position cap'inde ya da üstünde (MSFT %12.0, NVDA %11.4,
  JPM %10.4, V %10.0) → her Overweight konviksiyonu sıfıra kırpılıyor. Sharpe 2.59 / GO verdict'i
  bir STRATEJİYİ değil, donmuş bir buy-and-hold sepetinin mark-to-market'ini ölçüyor.
- **KÖK NEDEN — FİLED, KASITLI DÜZELTİLMEDİ (decision-path, HIGH blast, Canberk'in kararı):**
  `risk/sizer.py:45 _side_from_rating` → `Underweight` **None** dönüyor, yorumu "caller decides"
  ama **hiçbir caller karar vermiyor** — trade.py sadece reddi kaydediyor. Sistemdeki TEK çıkış
  yolu en sert tier olan `Sell`. Ajanın fiilen ürettiği "azalt" sinyali (60 günde 6 kez) yere
  düşüyor. Sonuç zinciri: trim yok → pozisyonlar %10 cap'in altına inmiyor → yeni BUY sonsuza
  kadar bloke; ayrıca negatif cash (−$856.29, 5. gün) hiç geri ödenmiyor.
  Fix = Underweight → kısmi SELL (cap'e geri kırp). Bunu tek taraflı deploy ETMEDİM: gerçek emir
  üreten bir exit politikası, tests + supervised paper run kuralına tabi ve boyutlandırma
  politikası (ne kadar trim?) Canberk'in çağrısı.
- Live: verdict GO (gates: Sharpe 2.59>1.0 ✅, MaxDD −2.69%<15% ✅, 21/10 gün ✅, SPY ❌ +3.29% vs
  +4.62% → α −1.33pt). Equity $107,352, cash −$856.29, 10 pozisyon, günlük −$1,602 (−1.47%).
  Realized (eval penceresi): 4 işlem, +$130.56, 4/0 — ama son fill 07-31.
- Sıradaki: (a) Underweight→SELL exit path (supervised, Canberk onayı), (b) actionability'yi
  mobil Settings/scorecard'a bağla + günlük push (inert>=3 gün), (c) SPY gate'i hard yapma kararı.

## Daily loop 2026-08-17 (eval CLOSED — GO 24/10d)
- [x] **sp500_history scraper fix** (backend, off-decision-path — 81f4976). Dün "bayat selector"
  diye not düşülen test'in kökü: Wikipedia **additions/removals tablosunu ayrı bir makaleye taşımış**
  ("List of S&P 500 companies" → "Historical components of the S&P 500", 1994'e kadar 408 satır).
  Scraper sadece eski makaleye bakıyordu.
  Asıl mesele test'in kırmızı olması değil, **kırmızı olmasaydı fark edilmeyecek olması**:
  `fetch_changes()` tabloyu bulamayınca `log.warning` + **boş liste** dönüyordu. Boş change listesi
  bozuk bir cevap değil, YANLIŞ bir cevap — `members_as_of()` geçmişi "bugünden geriye doğru her
  değişikliği geri alarak" kuruyor, dolayısıyla hiç değişiklik yoksa **2007 için bugünün endeksini**
  döndürüyor. Yani modülün var olma sebebi olan survivorship bias, hiçbir hata sinyali vermeden
  geri geliyordu (LEH, WaMu, Bear Stearns hiç var olmamış gibi).
  - `fetch_changes()` önce yeni makaleyi, sonra eskisini deniyor; ikisinde de tablo yoksa
    **`SP500HistoryUnavailable` raise ediyor** ve mesajda iki URL'i de adıyla anıyor (bir sonraki
    selector bayatlamasında sıfırdan başlanmasın diye).
  - `parse_changes(html)` fetch'ten ayrıldı → layout drift'i **network'süz** test edilebiliyor;
    pandas'ın spanning header hücrelerine verdiği `Unnamed: N_level_M` adları da temizleniyor
    (yeni makale iki satırlı MultiIndex header kullanıyor).
  - `members_as_of()` change listesinin **erişemediği tarihleri reddediyor** (boş liste ya da
    as_of < en eski değişiklik). Geriye yürüyüş no-op olduğunda sessizce bugünün evrenini
    "1990 evreni" diye vermek, veriyle desteklenmeyen bir cevabı emin görünümlü hale getiriyordu.
  - Canlı smoke test artık `SP500HistoryUnavailable`'ı yutmuyor: **sadece offline makine skip**
    (network probe'u constituents fetch'i), bayat selector fail eder.
  12 offline test + canlı scrape yeşil (**304 backend**). Backtest universe reconstruction dışında
  çağıranı yok — canlı karar yolunda değil. Box'a deploy + API restart, /healthz + /v1/eval 200.
- Live: verdict GO, Sharpe 1.92, Sortino 3.20, MaxDD −4.25%, Calmar 9.11, 24/10 gün, eval_complete.
  Getiri +3.03% vs SPY +2.85% → **α +0.18pp** (dünle birebir aynı — hafta sonu, yeni bar yok).
  Equity $108,923, cash −$856.29 (3. gün sabit → sizer cash cap tutuyor, yeni exposure yok),
  10 pozisyon, günlük −$30.70. Realized (eval penceresi): 4 işlem, +$130.56, 4W/0L.
- GO/NO-GO durumu **değişmedi**: tek açık kalem SPY hard-gate kararı. α +0.18pp gürültü seviyesinde
  ve eval penceresinde hâlâ sadece 4 kapanmış işlem var → exit disiplini hakkında istatistiksel
  olarak hiçbir şey bilmiyoruz. Gerçek para kararı Canberk'in.
- Sıradaki: (a) SPY hard-gate kararı, (b) reflection memory on realized fills (branch),
  (c) cost-opt merge hazırlığı (önce stale model ID'leri tazele: opus-4-7/sonnet-4-6 → 4.8/5).

## Daily loop 2026-08-16 (eval CLOSED — GO 24/10d)
- [x] **Realized ledger eval penceresine göre kapsandı** (backend + OTA, off-decision-path — d1a3c5e).
  Üç loop'tur "agent kapattığı her işlemde para kaybediyor" diye okunan tablo yanlış kitabı ölçüyormuş.
  Forensic: 30 kapanmış round trip'in **24'ü tek gün** (2026-06-24 13:30–13:35 UTC, −$656.86) kapanmış.
  Alpaca order feed'i net: `market SELL 99 AAPL` + `market SELL 103 MSFT`, `order_class=None`,
  client_order_id broker-üretimi UUID, tüm bracket stop leg'leri aynı anda `canceled` →
  bu bir `close_all_positions` (FLATTEN). Günlük run log'larında o gün hiç SELL kararı yok, box'ta
  o saatte hiç aktivite yok. Yani strateji çıkışı değil: **over-buying bug'ı düzeltilirken
  (2cf196a) biriken AAPL/MSFT lot'ları kasıtlı olarak flatten edilip kitap temizlendi**, universe
  3→11'e çıktı ve ertesi gün `EVAL_START_DATE=2026-06-24` cutoff'u eklendi (78fadb3).
  `/v1/eval` o günden beri cutoff'u uyguluyordu, ledger uygulamıyordu — iki kart iki farklı kitabı
  ölçüyordu.

  | | window=eval (yeni default) | window=all (eski davranış) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Kapanan işlem | 4 | 30 |
  | Net realized | **+$130.56** | −$531.93 |
  | Win rate | 4W / 0L (%100) | %26.7 |
  | Expectancy | +$32.64 | −$17.73 |
  | Profit factor | — (henüz kayıp yok) | 0.22 |
  | Ort. tutma | 26.0 gün | 5.6 gün |

  Cutoff **giriş** tarihine uygulanıyor, çıkışa değil: girişi temiz kitap öncesi olan bir round trip'i
  bugünkü exit disiplininin kanıtı saymak yanlış — pozisyonu seçen ve boyutlandıran eski agent.
  `eval_window.py` tek parser: naive değer UTC okunuyor (broker fill'leri UTC; local anchor cutoff
  günündeki işlemleri yeniden sınıflandırırdı) ve bozuk değer **raise ediyor** — sessizce "cutoff yok"a
  düşmek, all-time rakamları eval-penceresi etiketiyle göstermek olurdu. Filtre SQL'de (limit
  kullanıcının göreceği satırları saysın diye), `excluded_pre_eval` her iki window'da da raporlanıyor;
  mobil kart "Eval penceresi (2026-06-24): temiz kitap öncesi 26 işlem hariç." satırını gösteriyor —
  30 işlemden 4'e sessizce düşen bir sicil cherry-picking gibi okunur. 4 işlem MIN_SAMPLE=30'un çok
  altında olduğu için kart hâlâ renksiz + "anlamlı değil" caveat'ıyla render ediyor.
  34 yeni test (291 backend, 167 jest), tsc temiz (2 bilinen pre-existing hariç).

  10 pozisyon. Realized (eval penceresi): 4 işlem, +$130.56.
- **GO/NO-GO durumu değişmedi ama zemini değişti:** 08-14'te "NO-GO" gerekçesi iki ayaktı —
  (a) SPY gate'i hard yapılsa geçemez, (b) realized expectancy negatif. (b) artık geçersiz: negatif
  expectancy pre-eval flatten'ın artefaktıydı. (a) hâlâ açık ve asıl mesele: α +0.18pp ile SPY'ı
  "yenmek" gürültü seviyesinde, ayrıca eval penceresinde sadece 4 kapanmış işlem var → exit disiplini
  hakkında hâlâ istatistiksel olarak hiçbir şey bilmiyoruz. Gerçek para kararı Canberk'in.
- Not (bu değişiklikle ilgisiz, pre-existing): `tests/test_dataflows_smoke.py::test_sp500_history_survivor_safe`
  temiz tree'de de fail — Wikipedia S&P 500 makalesinin "changes" tablosu artık bulunamıyor
  (scraper selector'ı bayat). Sadece backtest universe reconstruction'ı etkiliyor, canlı karar
  yolunda değil.

  zero splits into a close + an open; partials stay separate lots at their own prices; deterministic
  trade ids = hash of entry+exit activity ids so a full replay converges instead of duplicating),
  `AlpacaClient.list_fill_activities` (paginated `/account/activities/FILL` — the ORDER record
  reports an average fill price and gets pruned, so the activities feed is the only correct input),
  derived `closed_trades` table + `scripts/reconcile.py` + hourly `ai-trader-reconcile.timer`, and
  `GET /v1/trades` (stats computed over exactly the rows returned, so a ticker filter yields that
  name's record; `profit_factor` is None not ∞ with no losses yet). Full replay by design — a
  "fills since last run" window mis-pairs every trade whose entry predates it.
  **Matcher validated against live data:** 78 fills → 30 closed trades, and every symbol's leftover
  open lots reconcile EXACTLY to the live position quantity (AAPL 11+4+17+1=33, NVDA 8+41+3+2+1=55,
  all ten names). 33 new tests, 250 backend green.
- ⚠️ **What the ledger immediately revealed** — realized and unrealized disagree sharply:

  | | Equity curve (/v1/eval) | Realized ledger (/v1/trades) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Verdict | GO, 24/10 gün | — |
  | Return / P&L | +5.38% (Sharpe 3.46) | **−$531.93 net** |
  | Win rate | — | **26.7%** (8W / 22L) |
  | Profit factor | — | **0.22** |
  | Expectancy | — | **−$17.73/trade** |

  Read it carefully before drawing conclusions: the 30 round trips are small trims (avg win $18,
  avg loss $31, best $47, worst −$94) against a $109.5k book — the core thesis positions are ALL
  still open, and 100% of the +$9.5k gain is unrealized mark-to-market. So this is not "the
  strategy loses money"; it is **the trimming/exit discipline has had negative expectancy, and the
  entire reported performance is unrealized**. The GO gates measure a fully-invested long book in a
  rising tape. Worth weighing against the go-live decision; 30 trades is still a small sample.
- Live: verdict GO, Sharpe 3.46, Sortino 6.02, MaxDD −4.25%, Calmar 18.23, +5.38% vs SPY +3.74%
  (α +1.64pt), 24/10 gün, eval_complete. Equity $109,574, cash **−$510.54** (margin!), 10 pozisyon.
- Found + filed, NOT silently fixed: sizer has no cash cap → the book is 0.47% levered (see the
  Round-4-later item above). `assert acct.cash >= 0` removed from the Alpaca smoke test because it
  was a portfolio-policy claim smuggled into an account-parse test, with the reason documented at
  the call site.
- Sıradaki: reflection memory on realized fills (now unblocked — closed_trades is the input), ya da
  mobil "Gerçekleşen" kartı (/v1/trades wrap: win rate + expectancy on the scorecard), ya da sizer
  cash cap (decision-path → tests + supervised run).

## Daily loop 2026-08-03 (eval CLOSED — GO 22/10d)
- [x] **item 5 slice-2 — cancel order** (backend + OTA). Backend `POST /v1/orders/{id}/cancel` was
  three lies in twelve lines: it answered `{"status":"cancelled"}` for orders that were never at the
  broker (nothing cancelled), it never wrote an `OrderUpdate` (local DB kept the order live), and an
  Alpaca refusal (422 "order is not cancelable" = it already filled) surfaced as an opaque 500 *after*
  reporting success. Rewritten: `s.get(TradeOrderRow, id)` (was an O(n) scan of list_open_orders) →
  404 unknown / 409 "not at broker, use /reject" / 502 with the broker message on refusal, and a
  CANCELLED+`user_cancelled` update persisted ONLY after the broker acks. Deliberately no row on
  failure — the order is still live and can still fill; the broker-enriched /v1/orders view stays SoT
  (Alpaca acks with 204→`pending_cancel`, terminal `canceled` lands async).
  Mobile: `useCancelOrder` (invalidates orders+portfolio — a cancel that loses the race to a fill
  changes the book), Geçmiş cards get a confirm-gated destructive "Emri iptal et" (44pt, a11y label
  naming ticker+side+size, error Alert says the order may still be open) rendered only when
  `isCancellable(status, broker_order_id)`; unknown statuses → no button (a 502 on a money screen is
  worse than a missing button). `rejection_reasons` now render on the card, TR-translated by key with
  the numbers kept verbatim (`position_pct=12.40% exceeds 10%` → "Tek isim limiti (12.40% exceeds 10%)").
  Pure helpers in `utils/orders.ts`, 13 new jest (139 total), tsc clean except the 2 known pre-existing.
- [x] **latent test-isolation bug** found by the new tests: `tests/test_api_analyze.py` patched
  `api.deps.get_repo` BEFORE first importing `api.main`, so every route module froze
  `Depends(<_NoOpRepo lambda>)` for the whole session — any later test overriding `get_repo` silently
  got _NoOpRepo (kill-switch tests only escaped because their repo calls are try/except'd). Fixed by
  importing the app before the patch. 217 backend tests green.

- [x] **Sizer settled-cash cap** (decision-path, eval kapalı olduğu için deploy edildi — 6ebafe5).
  `position_sizing` içindeki HER cap equity'nin bir yüzdesi; tam yatırımlı long bir kitabın equity'si
  mark'larla birlikte büyüdüğü için her günün alımı zaten harcanmış parayla boyutlandırılıyordu.
  Canlı paper hesap 3. gündür **cash −$856.29 / equity $109k** — Alpaca'nın 4x margin buying power'ı
  ($304k) finanse ediyordu; strateji hiç margin istemedi. İki delik kapatıldı:
  1. `apply_cash_cap` — settled cash cinsinden tek cap. Aşağı yuvarlar, negatif cash'te 0 verir
     (levered kitap yeni exposure almaz). **SELL muaf**: satış cash üretir, onu cash'e bağlamak
     pozisyonu tam da çıkılması gereken drawdown'da kilitlerdi.
  2. `risk/cash_budget.py` — `daily_run.sh` trade.py'ı ticker başına AYRI process çalıştırıyor ve
     post-close emirler dolmadan hepsi bitiyor; 11 process aynı `account.cash`'i okuyup her biri
     "hepsini harcayabilirim" diyordu. Process'leri kapsayan tek state broker'ın **open order book**'u:
     pending BUY notional'ı cash'ten rezerve ediliyor → 11 bütçe tek yürüyen bütçe olur, lock/DB yok.
  Fiyatlanamayan pending BUY `None` döner (0.0 DEĞİL) ve çağıran bunu reddetmeye çevirir — bilinmeyen
  taahhüdü "taahhüt yok" saymak düzeltilen iyimserliğin ta kendisi. `available_cash=None` hâlâ
  "çağıran bir şey vermedi" demek ve cap'i atlar, yani eksik input her emri sessizce reddedemez.
  21 yeni test (270 backend yeşil). Canlı dry-run doğrulandı: AAPL buy artık
  `trimmed_to_zero_by_cash_cap (spendable=$0.00)` ile reddediliyor.
- Live: verdict GO, Sharpe 2.23, Sortino 3.74, MaxDD −4.25%, Calmar 11.04, 23/10 gün, eval_complete.
  Getiri **+3.42% vs SPY +3.46% → α −0.04pp**. Equity $109,095, cash −$856.29, 10 pozisyon.
- **NOT (GO/NO-GO için asıl mesele):** verdict "GO" diyor ama `_verdict()` içinde "beats SPY"
  bilerek *hard gate değil, flag* (kod yorumu: "not a hard gate, but a flag"). task_plan'ın kendi
  GO tanımı ise Sharpe>1.0 **VE** MaxDD<15% **VE** SPY'ı yener. Bu tanıma göre dürüst sonuç **NO-GO**.
  Üstüne realized ledger: **30 kapanmış işlem, net −$531.93, %27 win rate, profit factor 0.22,
  expectancy −$17.73/işlem**. Yani +3.42%'nin tamamı hâlâ TUTULAN pozisyonların mark-to-market'i;
  agent'ın fiilen KAPATTIĞI her şey para kaybetmiş. Gate semantiğini tek taraflı değiştirmedim —
  gerçek para kararını çeviren bir tanım değişikliği, Canberk'in çağrısı.
- Sıradaki: (a) SPY gate'i hard yap kararı, (b) realized negatif expectancy'nin kökü — exit mantığı
  (bracket TP/SL seviyeleri erken kesiyor mu? avg_win $18 vs avg_loss $31), (c) reflection memory.

## Daily loop 2026-08-10 (eval CLOSED — GO 24/10d)
- [x] **Mobil "Gerçekleşen" kartı** (OTA, off-decision-path). Dünkü ledger backend'de duruyordu ama
  app hâlâ SADECE unrealized gösteriyordu: hero equity, günlük P&L, eval scorecard — hepsi açık
  pozisyonların mark-to-market'i. Portfolio ekranına equity chart'ın hemen altına realized kart:
  net gerçekleşen P&L (büyük, tonlu), kapanan işlem sayısı + K/Z/B dağılımı, win rate / expectancy /
  profit factor, ve asıl mesele olan **realized-vs-unrealized split bar** (accent = bankaya yazılan,
  gri = hâlâ değerlemede) + tek satırlık dürüst okuma.
  Dürüstlük kuralları koda gömüldü (`utils/realized.ts`, saf + test edilebilir):
  `MIN_SAMPLE=30` altında hiçbir istatistik yeşile/kırmızıya boyanmıyor (3 işlemde %100 win rate
  gürültüdür, yeşile boyamak app'in olmayan bir edge'i iddia etmesidir) — değer yine render ediliyor,
  sadece renksiz ve caveat satırıyla. `profit_factor: null` (henüz kayıp yok) em dash, asla ∞ veya
  uydurma tavan. Split payı **net toplama değil, mutlak büyüklüklere** bölünüyor: realized −$532'ye
  karşı unrealized +$9.5k'da net-paydalı oran "−%5 gerçekleşti" gibi anlamsız bir sayı verirdi.
  `reconcileFreshness` naive backend timestamp'ini UTC olarak parse ediyor (cihaz saat farkı yaşı
  kaydırıp stale bayrağını ters çevirirdi) ve saatlik timer 3 saati geçince ⚠︎ gösteriyor —
  endpoint bilerek istek üzerine reconcile ETMİYOR, o yüzden bayatlık görünür olmak zorunda.

  Realized ledger: 30 işlem, −$531.93 net, %26.7 win rate — yani app artık iki rakamı da gösteriyor.

- **Alpaca paper bir seans geride roll ediyor:** 10-12 bar'ı geldi (gün 20→21, `last_equity`
  $113,076.66 = 10-12 kapanışı), 10-13 HENÜZ YOK (history 10-12'de bitiyor; snapshot equity 10-13
  MTM). Columbus Day'den beri roll bir gün geç → eval son seansı görmüyor. Yarın: 2 bar mı geldi

  kararı indikatörleri 10-12 bar'ıyla verildi (10-12 c=172.15 vs 10-13 c=174.08). Nedensellik
  iddiası değil ama `fix/ohlcv-settle-newest-close` merge kararının (Canberk) somut kanıtı.

  ~%27'lik dilim (3/11) indikatörleri bir seans erken bitiriyor. Laptop'ta bugün yeniden
  üretilemedi (Yahoo artık settled veriyor). Mekanizma adayları: (a) Yahoo son bar için adjclose

  Yahoo chart JSON'unun son satırları (UTC+NY damga, OHLCV, adjclose), vendor'ın birebir
  `yf.download` çağrısı, aynısı `auto_adjust=False`, aynısı `end`+1 gün. Varyant hatası kayda
  geçer, script hep 0 döner; trader'ın cache'ine dokunmaz (ubuntu kullanıcısı, ayrı yfinance
  cache). 10 test; suite 2332 pass / 2 fail = laptop Alpaca key 401 (`/v2/clock`, değişiklikten

- **Fix kararı probe'dan sonra** (karar girdisini değiştirir → branch + Canberk): (a) adjclose
  yoksa: son bar için ham OHLC'yi kullan (son bar'da ayar oranı 1); (b) live satır ise: settled
  satırı Alpaca/Polygon daily bar'dan doldur; tetikleyici saatse operasyonel çözüm de var —

  DST bitince 20:00 ET = 01:00 UTC → saat tetikleyicisiyse pencere bir saat kayar.

  Alpaca 1D bar'ı seans günü **20:00 New York** damgalıyor = ertesi gün 00:00 UTC; `_equity_series`
  UTC okuyordu → Cuma kapanışı "Cumartesi", hiç Pazartesi yok. Sonuçları: (1) `_spy_return` SPY'ı
  equity baseline'ından BİR SONRAKİ seanstan okuyordu → ilk seansın SPY hareketi benchmark'tan
  düşüyordu (1M: 2.99 vs doğru 2.37; 3M ters yönde 3.38 vs 3.82 — kayma iki yöne de vuruyor, yani
  10-10'daki "SPY'ı geçemiyor" NO-GO okuması da aynı kaymalı pencerenin üstündeydi); (2)
  `EVAL_START_DATE` cutoff'tan önceki seansı baseline olarak içeri alıyordu (box'ta şu an set değil);
  (3) `/v1/portfolio/history` her noktası + app'teki SPY overlay (tarih eşleştiriyor) bir gün kaymış.
  Fix: bar'lar New York seans tarihiyle indexleniyor (UTC midnight, index tipi aynı). Test fixture'ları

  damgalar seans tarihlerini sabitliyor. 5 yeni/değişen test eski kodda kırmızı. Suite 2322 pass /

  challenge'ı "standing outage" diye geçici hatadan ayırıyor, asla fail/page etmiyor (rotate
  edilecek key yok). Challenge'ı aşmak = bot-detection bypass → YAPILMAZ. 5 yeni test, 2080 pass /
  2 fail = laptop Alpaca key 401 (doğrulandı). Karar yoluna dokunmuyor.
- **Sıradaki:** (a) StockTwits için karar: kaynağı prompt'tan çıkar (decision change → branch +
  supervised run) ya da resmi/ücretli feed; (b) naked-alert + verdict-lag branch'lerinin merge'ü;
  (c) alarmlar hâlâ kimseye gitmiyor (push cihazı yok, HEALTHCHECK_URL/OPS_ALERT_GITHUB_TOKEN boş) = Canberk.

## Daily loop 2026-10-05 (prod-fusapp01 @5887545 → 53f4da8; eval gün 22 GO)
- **Canlı durum** (box localhost): eval 1M **GO** — Sharpe 1.66, Sortino 3.01, MaxDD −1.62%,
  +2.01% vs SPY −0.21%, 22/10 gün (değişmedi: hafta sonu). Equity $111,400.48, cash $24,238.03,
  8 pozisyon, hepsinde `stop_loss` dolu (6b8452a canlı), günlük −$114 (−0.10%).
  Yeni kodun (#90 time exit) ilk gerçek koşusu: **bugün 22:30 UTC** (preflight 21:45).
- [x] **`scripts/deploy_webapp.sh`** — `/app` 503'ü bu script'e işaret ediyordu ama dosya hiç
  yoktu; her web deploy elle export+tar+scp'ydi. Script: `EXPO_NO_DOTENV=1` + `env -i`,
  EXPO_PUBLIC_* eas.json `preview` profilinden → laptop `.env` (dev token, stg URL) bundle'a giremez.
  Değer bazlı leak gate: lokal `.env`'lerdeki KEY/SECRET/TOKEN/PASSWORD değerleri (≥12 char,
  public EXPO_PUBLIC_* hariç, dev token dahil) bundle'da aranır, sadece isim raporlanır;
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_API_TOKEN` referansı; profile API URL'i bundle'da yoksa WRONG TARGET.
  İsim bazlı kontrol bilerek yok (settings.tsx "DEV_API_TOKEN" metni + client.ts localhost:8000
  fallback'i ilk taslakta false-positive verdi). Atomic swap (2 rename), son 3 bak tutulur, smoke 200.
  7 test (bash 3.2 ile), suite 2075 pass / 2 fail = laptop ölü Alpaca key 401. Prod'a script ile
  deploy edildi + smoke yeşil; rollback `webapp.bak-20261005-061607`.
- Not: GitHub `canberkaslan/trading` → `fusapp/trading`'e taşınmış (push redirect ile çalışıyor).
